Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020). \n\n## Federal Orders\n\n- **Proclamation 9994 – ** *National Emergency Concerning COVID-19*  \n  **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020 ([Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic | The White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *N/A during 2020–2021* (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021 ([Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic | The White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation)))  \n  **Rescinded By:** Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  \n\n  **Summary:** This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak ([Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic | The White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation)). It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did **not** itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In **Q3 2020**, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.\n\n- **CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – ** *Federal Mask Requirements for Travel*  \n  **Date Enacted:** January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *Not rescinded in 2021* (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)  \n\n  **Summary:** Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in **Q3 2020**, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures, but the **Q3 2020** business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.\n\n*Federal Note:* The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.\n\n## California State Orders\n\n- **State of Emergency Proclamation – ** *California COVID-19 State of Emergency*  \n  **Order Number:** N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  \n  **Date Enacted:** March 4, 2020 ([Governor Newsom Declares State of Emergency to Help State Prepare for Broader Spread of COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *Not rescinded during 2020–2021* (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)  \n\n  **Summary:** Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19 ([Governor Newsom Declares State of Emergency to Help State Prepare for Broader Spread of COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death)). This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (e.g. suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In **Q3 2020**, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (like fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.\n\n- **Executive Order N-33-20 – ** *Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order*  \n  **Date Enacted:** March 19, 2020 ([CAP14-20200320110132](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as)) (effective immediately)  \n  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021 ([CAP14-20210611124926](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the))  \n  **Rescinded By:** Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021 ([CAP14-20210611124926](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the)). Also superseded by later phased reopening orders.\n\n  **Summary:** This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It **ordered all individuals** in California **to stay at home** except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors ([CAP14-20200320110132](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as)). It forced “non-essential” businesses (like dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or shift to minimum basic operations, while “essential” businesses (food stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) could remain open with precautions. In **Q3 2020**, the *direct* effects of this March order had evolved – by that summer, California was gradually reopening some sectors – but many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints that stemmed from this original shutdown. For example, retail shops and restaurants in Q3 2020 were only allowed limited operations (outdoor or reduced capacity) because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay-home mandate. The order’s continuation (it was in force “until further notice” ([CAP14-20200320110132](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20California%20Department%20of,Health%20and%20Safety%20Code%20120125))) reflected the sustained risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and case trends improved by mid-2021 ([As California Fully Reopens, Governor Newsom Announces Plans to Lift Pandemic Executive Orders | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/06/11/as-california-fully-reopens-governor-newsom-announces-plans-to-lift-pandemic-executive-orders/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,county%20tier%20system%20will%20end)). The presence of this order (and its modifying successors) in Q3 2020 meant businesses were still far from normal – it explains why, that quarter, many Camarillo businesses were either closed or severely limited in service. \n\n- **State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – ** *Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)*  \n  **Order Date/Number:** May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20) ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=with%20Executive%20Order%20N,finally%20an%20easing%20of%20final))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021 ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)) (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order)  \n  **Rescinded By:** State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), §5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)).\n\n  **Summary:** As COVID case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began **“Stage 2”** of reopening. Consistent with Governor Newsom’s *Resilience Roadmap*, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to **relax the March stay-home restrictions** ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=with%20Executive%20Order%20N,finally%20an%20easing%20of%20final)). It allowed **lower-risk businesses** to reopen with modifications: for example, **retail stores** (clothing, bookstores, florists, etc.) could offer curbside pickup, and manufacturing supply chains for those retailers could resume ([PORT OF HUENEME BRIEFING FOR CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) - The Port of Hueneme](https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%208%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20On,manufacturing%20and%20supply%20chain%20businesses)). However, higher-risk establishments (dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons, etc.) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in **Q3 2020**, this Stage 2 order was part of the gradual reopening that led into summer – by July, many local retailers were operating (at least in curbside or limited-capacity modes) thanks to the Stage 2 easing. The rationale was to revive economic activity while still controlling spread. However, **because COVID surged in summer 2020**, these initial reopenings were soon paused or reversed (see July order below), which significantly affected businesses in Q3 2020 – many had to scale back operations again just weeks after reopening, underscoring the tenuous situation that quarter.\n\n- **State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – ** *Statewide Rollback of Reopening*  \n  **Order Date:** July 13, 2020 ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *Superseded* August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021 ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order))  \n  **Rescinded By:** State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system; and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)).\n\n  **Summary:** In July 2020, California experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. In response, the State Health Officer **re-imposed lockdown measures** on previously reopened sectors. **Statewide**, this July 13 order **closed many indoor operations** that had been allowed in Stage 2: for example, restaurants had to shut **indoor dining** (outdoor and take-out were allowed), bars, breweries and movie theaters were closed, and museums/zoos were closed again indoors ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to)). Additionally, counties on the state’s monitoring list (areas with the worst outbreaks, which included Ventura County) had to **close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non-critical offices, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and malls** ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to)). This had a **major impact in Q3 2020**: Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June had to partially or fully close again in July. For example, **restaurants in Camarillo during Q3 2020 could only offer outdoor dining or takeout**, and gyms and salons were forced shut for the remainder of the summer. These renewed restrictions in the middle of Q3 dramatically cut business revenues and operations. The reason for this rollback was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID-19” in California ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to)) – essentially, the summer surge forced the state to hit the “emergency brake,” directly affecting businesses in that quarter. \n\n- **“Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – ** *Color-Tier Reopening System*  \n  **Order Number:** State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  \n  **Date Enacted:** August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) ([Governor Newsom Unveils Blueprint for a Safer Economy, a Statewide, Stringent and Slow Plan for Living with COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021 ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order))  \n  **Rescinded By:** State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective 6/15/2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)).\n\n  **Summary:** California unveiled the **Blueprint for a Safer Economy** on Aug. 28, 2020 as a long-term, **color-coded tier system** for COVID-19 restrictions ([Governor Newsom Unveils Blueprint for a Safer Economy, a Statewide, Stringent and Slow Plan for Living with COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease)). This new framework replaced the blunt monitoring-list closures with a **graduated, risk-based approach**. Every county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial, Orange = moderate, Yellow = minimal) based on local case rates and positivity%. Each tier set specific rules for businesses: e.g. in Purple tier (the most restrictive), many non-essential indoor business operations were prohibited, whereas in Red or Orange tiers, certain indoor operations could open with capacity limits ([Governor Newsom Unveils Blueprint for a Safer Economy, a Statewide, Stringent and Slow Plan for Living with COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=New%20plan%20imposes%20risk,state%3B%20expands%20time%20between%20changes)) ([Governor Newsom Unveils Blueprint for a Safer Economy, a Statewide, Stringent and Slow Plan for Living with COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=The%20Blueprint%20builds%20on%20lessons,19%20transmissions.%20It%20includes)). Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) **entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on Aug 31, 2020**, since case rates were high ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health)) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=data,the%20opening%20of%20businesses%20as)). In **Q3 2020**, this meant that although the blanket July closures were lifted, most Camarillo businesses still faced heavy restrictions: **retail stores** could open indoors with limited capacity, but **indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed** in Purple tier (only outdoor or take-home services allowed). As conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier by October, easing some rules. The Blueprint’s purpose was to provide a predictable structure: it **gradually reopened businesses in Q3/Q4 2020** when COVID metrics improved, but also allowed tightening if metrics worsened ([Governor Newsom Unveils Blueprint for a Safer Economy, a Statewide, Stringent and Slow Plan for Living with COVID-19 | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=New%20plan%20imposes%20risk,state%3B%20expands%20time%20between%20changes)). For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, the Blueprint meant their operating status was tied to Ventura County’s tier – and during that quarter the county was mostly in the most restrictive tier, explaining why many businesses were still severely limited. The tier system remained in effect until statewide vaccinations and declining cases enabled California to **“retire” the Blueprint on June 15, 2021 ([As California Fully Reopens, Governor Newsom Announces Plans to Lift Pandemic Executive Orders | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/06/11/as-california-fully-reopens-governor-newsom-announces-plans-to-lift-pandemic-executive-orders/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,county%20tier%20system%20will%20end))**, at which point nearly all business restrictions were lifted.\n\n- **Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ** *ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown*  \n  **Order Date:** December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in SoCal region Dec 6, 2020) ([December 5, 2020 - Regional Stay At Home Order - Montclair, CA](https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=Late%20Friday%2C%20December%204%2C%202020%2C,the%20day%20before)) ([December 5, 2020 - Regional Stay At Home Order - Montclair, CA](https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=,Californians%E2%80%99%20physical%20and%20mental%20health))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** January 25, 2021 ([\n\t\n\tSupplement to Regional Stay At Home Order\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority))  \n  **Rescinded By:** State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order statewide (Jan. 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved ([\n\t\n\tSupplement to Regional Stay At Home Order\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority)).\n\n  **Summary:** In late 2020, facing a dire winter COVID surge, California introduced the **Regional Stay-at-Home Order** – a stricter lockdown tied to ICU (intensive care unit) capacity.

The Regional Order essentially pulled counties back to full shutdown if their region’s hospitals were in crisis. **It required the closure of many business sectors, both indoor and outdoor**: e.g. **restaurants had to stop outdoor dining (take-out only), personal care services (hair and nail salons) closed entirely, movie theaters, museums, and amusement centers closed**, and retail stores had to further reduce capacity (down to 20%) ([December 5, 2020 - Regional Stay At Home Order - Montclair, CA](https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=In%20any%20region%20that%20triggers,the%20following%20sectors%20must%20close)) ([December 5, 2020 - Regional Stay At Home Order - Montclair, CA](https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=,Additionally%2C%20special%20hours%20should)). This was the most stringent measure since spring. Although this order took effect in **Q4 2020**, its *impact carried into early Q1 2021*, and it highlighted the precarious situation businesses faced. (By Q3 2020, businesses might have hoped the worst was over, but the emergence of this order in December showed that restrictions could return if conditions worsened.) **Q3 2020 itself was not directly under the Regional Stay-at-Home Order**, but the looming threat of a resurgent virus (which materialized in winter) meant businesses remained cautious. The Regional Order was lifted on Jan. 25, 2021 when ICU forecasts improved, putting Ventura County back into the Purple tier system ([\n\t\n\tSupplement to Regional Stay At Home Order\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority)). The existence of this emergency brake mechanism is a reminder of why **Q3 2020 business conditions were tenuous** – the pandemic’s trajectory was uncertain, and even a quarter later businesses would face another round of closures due to factors (ICU strain) that were already a concern in mid-2020.\n\n- **“Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – ** *Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers*  \n  **Order Number:** Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  \n  **Date Enacted:** June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021) ([As California Fully Reopens, Governor Newsom Announces Plans to Lift Pandemic Executive Orders | Governor of California](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/06/11/as-california-fully-reopens-governor-newsom-announces-plans-to-lift-pandemic-executive-orders/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,county%20tier%20system%20will%20end)) ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** N/A (this order *ended* prior orders)  \n  **Rescinded By:** This order itself rescinded the remaining COVID business restrictions.

Practically, it lifted capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other COVID-related operating restrictions on businesses. After this date, **Camarillo businesses could generally operate at pre-pandemic levels** (subject only to any remaining mask rules or industry-specific guidance). In the context of **Q3 2020**, this June 2021 milestone highlights how far into the future the restrictions persisted. The fact that California did not fully lift business constraints until mid-2021 underscores why **Q3 2020 was heavily impacted** – businesses spent that quarter under evolving but continued rules, awaiting a normalcy that came roughly three quarters later. The **reason** this “Beyond the Blueprint” order could be issued was improving public health metrics (dropping cases and widespread vaccinations by spring 2021), which were absent in Q3 2020 – thus, businesses in mid-2020 had to contend with the stricter earlier orders until conditions allowed this final reopening.\n\n## Ventura County Orders\n\n- **Ventura County Local Health Emergency – ** *County Declaration of Local Health Emergency*  \n  **Order/Proclamation Date:** March 12, 2020 ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=spread%20of%20COVID,and%20local%20public%20health%20officials))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *Not rescinded in 2020–21* (county emergency remained in effect; ultimately ended in 2022)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, beyond our scope)\n\n  **Summary:** Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, **declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020** in response to COVID-19 ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=spread%20of%20COVID,and%20local%20public%20health%20officials)). This was quickly ratified by county authorities. The declaration itself didn’t impose restrictions on businesses, but it provided the legal basis for the County Health Officer to issue health orders and for the county to coordinate emergency resources. By establishing that a health emergency existed locally, it allowed Ventura County to mirror and enforce state orders (like shelter-in-place) and to act swiftly in targeting local outbreak conditions. For **Q3 2020**, this emergency status was still active, meaning Ventura County had the ongoing authority to issue local rules affecting Camarillo businesses. The local emergency’s continuation into late 2020 was due to the sustained threat of COVID-19 – it justified why the county could keep certain local rules (like mask recommendations or enforcement of state directives) in place, thereby impacting businesses throughout the quarter.\n\n- **Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – ** *Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions*  \n  **Order Date:** March 17, 2020 ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by the County’s **Stay Well at Home** order on March 20, 2020 ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)) (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this order ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)).\n\n  **Summary:** Prior to the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions. The **March 17, 2020 health officer order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain businesses and public facilities** until at least April 2, 2020 ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing)). In practice, this meant that even before Newsom’s statewide mandate, Ventura County had **shut down venues like bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters, and limited restaurants to take-out only** (mirroring guidance at the time). This local order was quickly eclipsed by the more comprehensive March 19 state order, and the county rolled it into a broader local stay-home order on March 20. However, it set the tone for aggressive local action. By **Q3 2020**, the specifics of the March 17 order had long been overtaken by later rules, but its legacy was that Ventura County didn’t hesitate to impose stricter measures if needed. The early timing shows the **county’s proactive approach**, which continued through 2020. The reason this order came about was immediate concern over COVID-19 spread in mid-March – and that same concern persisted into Q3, explaining why Ventura County remained vigilant with local enforcement of health measures that quarter.\n\n- **“Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – ** *Countywide Stay-Home Order*  \n  **Order Date:** March 20, 2020 ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=PUBLIC%20HEALTH%20AND%20UNDER%20THE,are%20hereby)) ([[PDF] Order of the Ventura County Health Office - Watt Tieder](https://watttieder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VenturaCounty-Public-Health-Officer-Order-June-28-2021.pdf#:~:text=Effective%20June%2015%2C%202021%2C%20the,Home)))  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Health Officer Order June 15, 2021, which noted the end of the Governor’s stay-home order and lifted remaining local restrictions ([[PDF] Order of the Ventura County Health Office - Watt Tieder](https://watttieder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VenturaCounty-Public-Health-Officer-Order-June-28-2021.pdf#:~:text=Effective%20June%2015%2C%202021%2C%20the,Home)).\n\n  **Summary:** Ventura County’s Stay Well at Home order, issued March 20, 2020, was the local companion to California’s statewide stay-home mandate. It **required all Ventura County residents to stay at their residences except for essential needs or jobs, and it closed all non-essential businesses and activities** ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)). This order made the state’s directives enforceable at the local level and added some county-specific provisions (like definitions of essential businesses and local enforcement mechanisms). Under this order, **virtually all Camarillo businesses had to cease in-person operations**, unless they were on the essential list (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, healthcare, etc.) ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)). This county lockdown was initially set through April 19, 2020 ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=essential%20activities%20and%20to%20operate,On)), but it was extended multiple times as the pandemic continued. By **Q3 2020**, the original “Stay Well at Home” had been amended to allow partial reopenings, but many of its core restrictions were still indirectly affecting businesses. For example, even if the strict stay-home was no longer in full force by July, capacity limits and partial closures (originating from this order’s framework) were still in effect. Businesses in Q3 2020 were operating under the modified descendants of the stay-home order. The **reason** it continued (in evolving form) through Q3 was that COVID-19 cases remained significant – the county could not simply lift the stay-home order without replacement rules until the public health situation improved. Thus, this order’s prolonged life explains why **Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 were still under significant restrictions**, as the county only exited the stay-home framework when the state did in June 2021 ([[PDF] Order of the Ventura County Health Office - Watt Tieder](https://watttieder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VenturaCounty-Public-Health-Officer-Order-June-28-2021.pdf#:~:text=Effective%20June%2015%2C%202021%2C%20the,Home)).\n\n- **Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – ** *Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols*  \n  **Order Dates:** March 31, 2020 (extended stay-home to 4/19/2020) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20March%2031%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,framework%20is%20based%20upon%20the)); April 9, 2020 (added gathering ban & safety protocols) ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=to%20help%20licensees%20with%20economic,19)) ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=H,and%20released%20a%20Notice%20of)); April 20, 2020 (further extended stay-home through 5/15/2020) ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)) ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing)).  \n  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond); fully rescinded by May 7, 2020 county order that repealed April orders in favor of state-aligned regulations ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=essential%20activities%20and%20to%20operate,On%202)).  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020, which **repealed the April 9 and April 20 orders** and replaced them with the “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=essential%20activities%20and%20to%20operate,On%202)).\n\n  **Summary:** Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its stay-home order. On **March 31, 2020**, the Health Officer extended the existing Stay Well at Home order’s duration ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20March%2031%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,framework%20is%20based%20upon%20the)). Then on **April 9, 2020**, as the county saw its first surge, an updated order **prohibited all gatherings (of any size outside a single household)** and required all essential businesses that remained open to implement **social distancing protocols** (posting COVID safety plans, ensuring 6-foot distancing, etc.) ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=to%20help%20licensees%20with%20economic,19)). An **April 20, 2020** order further tightened definitions of essential businesses and **continued the stay-home requirements into May** ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=to%20help%20licensees%20with%20economic,19)). These updates impacted businesses by adding new compliance steps – for example, grocery stores and pharmacies in Camarillo had to post distancing guidelines and limit entry, and any loopholes for quasi-non-essential operations were closed. In **Q3 2020**, those specific spring orders were no longer active (they had been replaced by the reopening framework), but their effects lingered: the habit of safety protocols (masking, distancing) and the baseline assumption that gatherings were banned carried forward. Essentially, these orders laid the groundwork for how businesses would operate when they were allowed to reopen – with distancing, masking, and limits. The reason the county kept extending and amending the stay-home order in early 2020 was the continuing high case counts; this persistence of the pandemic through the spring meant that by **Q3 2020, businesses were still coping with the aftermath** – they reopened under stringent guidelines that originated from these spring orders. Q3 businesses had to enforce the safety measures (like distancing and mask rules for customers/employees) first established in April, which affected customer throughput and operating costs during that quarter.\n\n- **“Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – ** *Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)*  \n  **Order Dates:** May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amendment) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20May%2020%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,A%20Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form)) ([PORT OF HUENEME BRIEFING FOR CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) - The Port of Hueneme](https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%2021%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20On,Stage%202%20path%20to%20reopening))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by state Blueprint (Aug 31, 2020) and later by June 15, 2021 reopening (no local restrictions remaining) ([\n\t\n\tOrder of the State Public Health Officer Beyond Blueprint\n\n](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)).  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Health Officer Order Aug. 31, 2020 (which aligned county to state Blueprint Tier 1) and ultimately the June 15, 2021 state order ending all tiered restrictions.\n\n  **Summary:** In early May 2020, as California signaled initial reopening, Ventura County’s Health Officer issued the **“Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” order** to implement Stage 2 locally. The **May 7, 2020 order repealed the stricter April county orders** and allowed Ventura County to **move in step with the state’s Phase 2 reopening starting May 8** ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=essential%20activities%20and%20to%20operate,On%202)). This meant certain businesses could reopen with safety measures: e.g. **retailers with curbside pickup, manufacturing, logistics, and warehouses supporting retail could resume work** ([PORT OF HUENEME BRIEFING FOR CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) - The Port of Hueneme](https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%208%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20On,manufacturing%20and%20supply%20chain%20businesses)). Then, on **May 20, 2020**, after Ventura County received state approval for an “accelerated Stage 2” variance, the Health Officer **amended the order to allow dine-in restaurants and in-store retail** with precautions ([PORT OF HUENEME BRIEFING FOR CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) - The Port of Hueneme](https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%2021%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20On,Stage%202%20path%20to%20reopening)). By late May, **Camarillo restaurants were allowed to reopen for dine-in service** (with reduced capacity and COVID protocols) and malls/shopping centers could open at limited capacity ([County of Ventura Approved by State for Accelerated Reopening](https://news.ventura.org/en/county-of-ventura-approved-by-state-for-accelerated-reopening-largest-county-in-the-state-to-be-approved/#:~:text=County%20of%20Ventura%20Approved%20by,Guidance%3A%20Shopping%20Malls%2C%20Destination)). For businesses in **Q3 2020**, these May orders were significant because they set the stage for what level of opening was possible by summer. Thanks to these orders, many Camarillo businesses *were* open in Q3 (unlike the complete shutdown of April) – however, they operated under the constant threat that reopening could be rolled back (as indeed happened in July). The Safely Reopening plan required each business to implement a COVID prevention plan, post social distancing notices, and in some cases register with the county for reopening ([PORT OF HUENEME BRIEFING FOR CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) - The Port of Hueneme](https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=Stage%202%20path%20to%20reopening)). So, a Camarillo restaurant in Q3 2020, for example, was open either outdoors or at limited indoor capacity because of these orders, but had to enforce distancing, mask-wearing, sanitation plans, etc. The **reason** these orders impacted Q3 is that they allowed reopening but with conditions – and when the summer surge hit, the freedoms they gave were partially rescinded (per the July state order). In summary, the Safely Reopening orders enabled a cautious economic revival in Q3 2020 but under strict health rules. \n\n- **Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – ** *Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)*  \n  **Order Date:** June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020) ([4th of July 2020: Ventura County beaches to close for ... - ABC7](https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** July 6, 2020 (order was limited to the Independence Day weekend)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Expired by its terms after July 5, 2020.\n\n  **Summary:** Anticipating crowding over the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID cases, Ventura County’s health officer **ordered beaches closed and beach parking lots off-limits for the July 4th, 2020 weekend** ([4th of July 2020: Ventura County beaches to close for ... - ABC7](https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County)). This short-term order aimed to prevent mass gatherings that could become “super-spreader” events. For Camarillo businesses in **Q3 2020**, this meant that any tourism or beach-related commerce (in nearby coastal areas like Ventura/Oxnard) was temporarily curtailed during what would normally be a busy weekend. For example, beach-adjacent restaurants saw fewer visitors, and outdoor recreation companies lost that holiday business. While Camarillo is inland, residents who might usually go to Ventura County beaches stayed home, potentially reducing holiday spending. This order highlights the broader environment of Q3 2020: authorities were willing to enact **targeted closures** on short notice in response to case trends. The beach closure was a **preemptive strike** given the “statewide surge in coronavirus cases” at that time ([4th of July 2020: Ventura County beaches to close for ... - ABC7](https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County)). It underscores why Q3 2020 was challenging for businesses – even if open, they faced sudden disruptions (like holiday shutdowns) aimed at controlling COVID-19. \n\n- **Ventura County July 2020 Order – ** *Local Implementation of State Rollback*  \n  **Order Date:** July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as county moved to Tier 2) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby))  \n  **Rescinded By:** Ventura County Health Officer Order Oct. 6, 2020, which allowed certain indoor operations again and explicitly **rescinded parts of the July 13 order** ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby)).\n\n  **Summary:** Following Governor Newsom’s July 13 statewide closures, Ventura County’s health officer issued a local order to implement those restrictions countywide. This **July 13, 2020 Ventura County order re-closed indoor operations for sectors like gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care services** that had been open, in line with the state mandate ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20Health%20Officer%20issued,are%20hereby)). It essentially ensured that Ventura County businesses complied with all the state’s rollback requirements. It also continued the closure of bars and indoor dining that had been mandated by the state. For **Q3 2020**, this meant Camarillo’s fitness studios, churches, nail salons, tattoo parlors, and other personal service businesses which may have opened in June had to shut indoor services again in July. Some could operate outdoors if feasible; others (e.g. tattoo shops) couldn’t easily move operations outside and had to remain closed. This local order remained in effect until Ventura’s COVID metrics improved in the fall – on Oct. 6, once Ventura County entered the Red tier, the health officer **rescinded the portions of the July order that closed gyms, churches, and personal care indoors**, allowing those to reopen with limits ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby)). The impact in **Q3 2020** was significant: for the rest of the quarter (July, August, September), those businesses were mostly closed or severely constrained. The **reason** was the summer case surge; only when cases fell and Ventura County’s tier status improved (just after Q3) were these businesses given relief. Thus, the July local order concretely explains why **businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020 (especially fitness, personal care, and hospitality venues) experienced a second round of closures and an extremely challenging quarter**.\n\n- **Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – ** *Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020*  \n  **Order Date:** October 6, 2020 ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health)) ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** January 25, 2021 (superseded by Regional Stay Home in Dec 2020 and then by return to Purple tier in Jan 2021)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Effectively superseded by the Dec 2020 Regional Stay Home Order (when Ventura had to close indoor operations again); formally, all county orders were nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening.\n\n  **Summary:** By early October 2020, Ventura County’s COVID rates had improved enough to move from the Purple tier to the Red tier in the state’s Blueprint system. The County Health Officer’s Oct. 6 order acknowledged this by **allowing specified businesses to reopen indoor operations with restrictions** ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=data,the%20opening%20of%20businesses%20as)). It **rescinded portions of the July 13 closure order** – notably, it permitted **gyms/fitness centers, houses of worship, and personal care services (like nail salons)** to resume indoor activities in compliance with state and county safety protocols ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby)). This was a welcome loosening: gyms and salons could operate indoors at limited capacity, and restaurants, which had already been allowed limited indoor dining under Red tier rules, continued under those guidelines. While this order came after Q3 2020, it is directly tied to the Q3 experience: businesses endured July–Sept mostly closed indoors, and this October order was the first real relief for those sectors. If we consider a Camarillo business in **late Q3 2020 (September)**, they were anxiously watching metrics, preparing for the possibility of reopening if the county improved. The October easing (just after Q3) happened because Ventura County’s COVID situation improved due to the restrictions in place during Q3. In other words, **Q3’s sacrifices by businesses (operating outdoors or not at all) paid off in October** with the ability to reopen some indoor services. Thus, this order illustrates the tail end of Q3’s story: the strict Q3 measures led to modest reopening, which however was short-lived – by December, the pandemic worsened again. For Q3 2020 though, this approaching Red tier status was the light at the end of the tunnel that justified why businesses complied with the summer’s painful measures.\n\n- **Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – ** *Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)*  \n  **Order/Ordinance Number:** Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  \n  **Date Enacted:** April 22, 2020 ([](https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20May%2012%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,A%20Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form)) (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020 ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=,Urgency%20Ordinance)))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** September 30, 2020 (for commercial evictions, after local extension) and replaced by state law for residential (from Sept 1, 2020 via AB 3088)  \n  **Rescinded By:** For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020, which extended eviction protections statewide. Ventura County’s commercial eviction moratorium was **extended by the Board** through September 30, 2020 ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Temporary%20Eviction%20Moratoriums,Commercial%20Only%29)) and then allowed to expire (the Governor later permitted local commercial eviction bans through March 2021, but Ventura did not extend beyond Sept. 2020 per available records).\n\n  **Summary:** Recognizing the financial hardship on businesses and residents, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors approved an **urgency ordinance preventing evictions of tenants (both residential and small-business commercial) who couldn’t pay rent due to COVID-19 impacts** ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=A,19%20pandemic)). This ordinance (No. 4563) took effect in late March/early April 2020 and **prohibited landlords in unincorporated Ventura County from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent if the tenant suffered substantial loss of income due to the pandemic** ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=A,19%20pandemic)). It covered commercial tenants as well, offering a lifeline to local small businesses (e.g. a Camarillo shop owner renting space in county jurisdiction) by delaying evictions. Initially set to expire May 31, 2020 (consistent with Governor Newsom’s EO N-28-20 authority) ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=Section%206%20of%20Urgency%20Ordinance,pursuant%20to%20the%20provisions%20of)), it was **extended by the County on May 28, 2020** to continue protections ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Ventura%20County)). Practically, this meant that a business in Camarillo that had lost revenue in Q2 could defer rent without losing their lease, although they would need to repay later. By **Q3 2020**, the state had taken over residential eviction rules, but **Ventura County’s moratorium on commercial evictions was still in effect through the end of Q3 (Sept 30, 2020)**. This greatly impacted businesses in that quarter: it gave some breathing room on rent obligations, which was crucial for survival given the reduced income under COVID restrictions. The *reason* these eviction protections were enacted was to prevent a wave of homelessness and business closures – policymakers knew that forced evictions during the pandemic would compound the public health crisis. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses were still struggling to pay expenses; the eviction moratorium meant they were shielded from losing their premises during the height of the COVID restrictions, allowing them to stay afloat until they could fully reopen. (It’s worth noting that while this helped businesses survive Q3, it was a temporary deferral – not a rent forgiveness – so many faced accumulating debt by the end of 2020.)\n\n## City of Camarillo Orders\n\n- **Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – ** *City Declaration of Emergency*  \n  **Order Number:** EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)  \n  **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020 ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=capacity%20as%20the%20City%20of,of%20the%20City%20Council%20at)) (ratified by City Council Reso. 20-36 on March 13, 2020)  \n  **Date Rescinded:** *Not rescinded in 2020–2021* (Camarillo’s local emergency remained in effect into 2021; lifted in 2022 following state/county lead)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022, outside our timeframe).\n\n  **Summary:** On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo **declared a local emergency** due to COVID-19, with City Manager Dave Norman (as EOC Director) issuing Order No. 20-1 and the City Council ratifying it that same day ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=capacity%20as%20the%20City%20of,of%20the%20City%20Council%20at)). This proclamation activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed the city to deploy resources and emergency measures quickly. Under this local emergency, Camarillo **closed city facilities and canceled public events** – for instance, City Hall, the public library, community center, and other city-run venues were closed to the public starting mid-March 2020 ([City of Camarillo: Past Press Releases - Camarillo Health Care District](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%2C%20California%20%E2%80%93%20Camarillo%20City,be%20available%20by%20appointment%20only)) ([City of Camarillo: Past Press Releases - Camarillo Health Care District](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%20City%20Hall%2C%20Public%20Works,Yard%2C%20and%20Sanitary%20District%20Offices)). These closures were critical for city operations and also impacted local businesses that rely on city services or events (e.g. permits, city-hosted farmers markets or fairs were suspended). In **Q3 2020**, Camarillo’s local emergency was still in place, which meant the city could continue to enact or enforce COVID-related rules (like park closures or mask requirements in city buildings) as needed. For a typical business in Q3 2020, the city’s emergency status meant **city regulatory relief** was possible – for example, Camarillo used its emergency powers to streamline permits for outdoor operations (see below) and to coordinate with county health orders. The presence of a city emergency also reinforced to the community the seriousness of the situation, which likely influenced customer behavior (residents heeding warnings, staying home more, etc., thereby affecting businesses). The **reason** Camarillo kept its emergency declaration through 2020 was aligned with county and state emergencies – the threat had not diminished, so to support the layered response (federal-state-county-city), Camarillo maintained its emergency stance. This enabled quick local action that directly affected businesses, such as creating outdoor dining zones or enacting eviction moratoria, throughout Q3 2020.\n\n- **Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – ** *Citywide Moratorium on Evictions*  \n  **Order Numbers:** EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and Amendment (April 23, 2020) ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo))  \n  **Date Enacted:** March 18, 2020 (initial order), amended April 23, 2020 ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo))  \n  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by state law (Sept 2020 for residential) and expired with end of local emergency (for any remaining commercial provisions)  \n  **Rescinded By:** California AB 3088 (Tenant Relief Act) on Aug. 31, 2020, which preempted local residential eviction bans, and Camarillo City Council Resolution terminating the city’s emergency (in 2022) which formally ended any remaining local orders.\n\n  **Summary:** The City of Camarillo took early action to protect tenants within the city. On March 18, 2020, City EOC Order No. 20-2 was issued to **“stay” evictions of residential *and commercial* tenants in Camarillo who were unable to pay rent due to COVID-19 financial hardship** ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo)). The City Council subsequently amended and extended this eviction moratorium on April 23, 2020 ([Temporary Eviction Moratoriums- Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) - Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo)). In effect, **landlords in Camarillo were temporarily prohibited from evicting businesses for non-payment of rent if the business had lost income due to the pandemic**. This local order paralleled the county’s efforts but applied within Camarillo city limits (important because the county’s ordinance didn’t automatically cover incorporated cities). For Camarillo businesses in **Q3 2020**, this meant that if they were behind on rent from spring/summer losses, they had some protection from being evicted, at least through the summer. (By September, the state law took over for residential tenants, and Camarillo’s moratorium for commercial likely aligned with the county’s timeline or was moot once the emergency ended.) The **impact** on a Q3 business was significant: a small retailer or restaurant renting space in Camarillo could use the moratorium to negotiate rent deferral and avoid legal eviction, giving them a chance to survive the lean months. It’s important to note this didn’t cancel rent – it delayed it – but it kept businesses from having to shut down permanently due to eviction in the middle of the pandemic. The **reason** Camarillo enacted its own eviction moratorium was to ensure that within city jurisdiction, tenants had at least the same protections as the county ordered (and to fill any gaps for commercial tenants). By reducing the immediate financial threat of eviction, businesses could focus on adapting operations in Q3 2020 (like outdoor sales or online services) without the looming fear of losing their storefront. This order was a key supportive measure that complemented the restrictive health orders, softening their economic blow in that quarter.\n\n- **Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – ** *Temporary Outdoor Dining Program*  \n  **Date Enacted:** June 10, 2020 (approximate – resolution passed in early June 2020)  \n  **Date Rescinded:** Expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the local emergency duration)  \n  **Rescinded By:** Automatic sunset as local COVID emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022.\n\n  **Summary:** To help restaurants survive under COVID restrictions, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution **2020-63** in June 2020 ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19)). This emergency measure **waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas** in parking lots, sidewalks, or other available open spaces ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19)). The resolution acknowledged that as dine-in service was permitted to resume under the state’s Stage 2 (with limited indoor capacity), many restaurants would need additional space to serve customers safely ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=J,19)). By waiving the usual permit fees and parking requirements, Camarillo enabled eateries to quickly expand outdoors without bureaucratic delays ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=J,19)). In **Q3 2020**, this was a lifeline for Camarillo’s dining establishments: when the July state order shut down indoor dining again, restaurants that had these outdoor setups could continue serving customers outside. Patrons eating on patios under canopies in Camarillo became a common sight in Q3 because of this policy. The resolution required that outdoor setups meet safety criteria (not blocking ADA access, maintaining fire lanes, etc.), but it cut through red tape at a critical time. The **reason** this mattered so much in Q3 is that restaurants were one of the hardest-hit businesses – indoor dining was on a regulatory rollercoaster. Camarillo’s proactive step here directly mitigated Q3 losses by allowing partial operation outdoors. It exemplifies how the city tried to balance public health and economic survival: acknowledging that **“physical distancing guidelines” would require reduced indoor seating**, the city provided a way to recoup some lost capacity outdoors ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=J,19)). Thanks to this, a Camarillo restaurant in Q3 2020 might have been able to operate at, say, 50% of its typical revenue (by serving outside) instead of 0% during the indoor closure. This measure was born from the recognition that COVID-19 would be with us for a while, and adapting the urban environment was necessary for businesses to function. By the time full indoor dining returned in 2021, the need for temporary outdoor expansions waned and the resolution’s provisions were phased out. But in the heart of **Q3 2020**, this city action was crucial in keeping many Camarillo businesses open and staffed.\n\n- **Miscellaneous City Measures – ** *Additional Camarillo Actions*  \n  **Dates:** Various in 2020 (spring–summer)  \n  **Summary:** In addition to the major items above, the City of Camarillo took several other steps in 2020 to support or regulate businesses under COVID conditions. For example, the City suspended late fees for business taxes, moved permit processes online for construction projects (so development could continue with minimal in-person contact) ([City of Camarillo: Past Press Releases - Camarillo Health Care District](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%2C%20California%20%E2%80%93%20Camarillo%20City,be%20available%20by%20appointment%20only)) ([City of Camarillo: Past Press Releases - Camarillo Health Care District](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%20City%20Hall%2C%20Public%20Works,Yard%2C%20and%20Sanitary%20District%20Offices)), and promoted take-out dining campaigns to support local restaurants. City code enforcement also worked with Ventura County to ensure businesses were complying with health orders in Q3 2020. While these were not “orders” per se, they were part of the COVID response framework that impacted Camarillo businesses. The overarching theme is that by **Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were operating in a very different regulatory landscape** – one shaped by emergency orders at every level of government. Federal and state proclamations created the emergency context, state and county health orders imposed restrictions, and local (county/city) orders provided both enforcement and relief measures. All of these combined explain why Q3 2020 was uniquely challenging: businesses had to navigate closures, reduced capacities, new safety requirements, and economic relief programs simultaneously. The extraordinary nature of the pandemic led to an equally extraordinary patchwork of orders aimed at saving lives and sustaining businesses, and Camarillo in Q3 2020 exemplified that balance.\n\n<br>**Sources:** The information above is drawn from official government releases and documents, including federal proclamations ([Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency Concerning the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic | The White House](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation)), California Governor’s executive orders and public health officer orders ([CAP14-20200320110132](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as)) ([CAP14-20210611124926](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the)) ([August 28 Order re Plan for Reducing COVID19 and Adjusting Permitted Sectors Signed](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to)), Ventura County Health Officer orders and county resolutions ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing)) ([](https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)), and City of Camarillo emergency orders and council resolutions ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=capacity%20as%20the%20City%20of,of%20the%20City%20Council%20at)) ([](https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=to%20help%20licensees%20with%20economic,19)).

The disallowance states that “no government orders were in effect” during that period to justify a suspension of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Below, we outline the multiple federal, state, county, and city orders that were active between April 1 and June 30, 2020, each of which imposed COVID-19 restrictions that limited our ability to operate Eldenism at full capacity. We also present our quarterly revenue data, demonstrating a significant decline that independently qualifies us for the ERC. Finally, we explain how supply chain disruptions under IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12 further support our ERC eligibility.\n\nI. Government Orders in Effect During Q2 2020\n\nThe following orders remained active or became effective in Q2 2020, causing partial suspensions of Eldenism’s normal business activities in Camarillo, CA, and Los Angeles, CA. Contrary to the IRS’s statement, these orders did not cease before or during Q2 2020; to the contrary, the mandates were heightened during this exact period, resulting in ongoing disruptions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19\n• Order Number: Proclamation 9994\n• Date Enacted: 03/13/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Remained in effect throughout 2020 (not rescinded during Q2 2020)\n• Order Summary: Declared a nationwide emergency in response to COVID-19, empowering federal agencies to issue public health measures and enabling states to impose lockdowns and business restrictions. While it did not itself require closures, it provided the legal basis for stricter directives at the state and local levels.\n• Impact on Quarter: Throughout April–June 2020, this ongoing federal declaration underscored the severity of the pandemic, allowing California and local authorities to impose operational restrictions on businesses (like Eldenism) in Camarillo and Los Angeles.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: California COVID-19 State of Emergency\n• Order Number: Governor’s Proclamation (03/04/2020)\n• Date Enacted: 03/04/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Remained in effect throughout 2020 (not rescinded during Q2 2020)\n• Order Summary: Declared a statewide emergency due to COVID-19, authorizing the Governor and health officers to issue orders significantly affecting business operations. Under this state-level emergency, subsequent stay-at-home and reopening orders could be implemented swiftly.\n• Impact on Quarter: During Q2 2020, Eldenism’s normal operations were subject to emergency authority rules, including capacity limitations and strict public health protocols, all proceeding from the Governor’s ongoing state of emergency.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order\n• Order Number: N-33-20\n• Date Enacted: 03/19/2020\n• Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021 (remained fully in effect throughout Q2 2020)\n• Order Summary: Mandated that all residents stay home unless performing essential tasks or working in essential sectors. Non-essential businesses had to close or operate under minimal basic operations; essential businesses could remain open with restrictions.\n• Impact on Quarter: This order severely curtailed Eldenism’s typical onsite operations in Q2 2020, as most non-essential activities were barred and any permissible functions were heavily restricted (masks, social distancing, and capacity control).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: State Public Health Officer Order (“Stage 2” Reopening)\n• Order Number: 05/07/2020 Order per EO N-60-20\n• Date Enacted: 05/07/2020\n• Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021 (remained active after superseding portions of the initial lockdown)\n• Order Summary: Allowed lower-risk businesses (mainly retail with curbside pickup, manufacturing, etc.) to reopen under strict health modifications. Higher-risk establishments (e.g., dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons) generally remained closed at that stage.\n• Impact on Quarter: While partial reopening occurred in Q2 2020, Eldenism could not fully operate due to ongoing capacity restrictions and social distancing mandates. The unpredictable shifts in allowable operations caused continuous disruption, including lost clientele and reduced staffing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Ventura County Local Health Emergency\n• Order Number: Local Health Emergency Declaration (03/12/2020)\n• Date Enacted: 03/12/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020 (remained in effect through Q2 2020)\n• Order Summary: Declared a local health emergency, enabling the County Health Officer to impose additional rules on top of state directives if needed. This heightened enforcement and alignment with state orders inside Ventura County.\n• Impact on Quarter: During Q2 2020, Eldenism’s Camarillo location was subject to both the state order and local enforcement under this ongoing county health emergency—enforcing local closure rules, social distancing, and potential fines for non-compliance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” Order\n• Order Number: County Health Officer Order (03/20/2020)\n• Date Enacted: 03/20/2020\n• Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021 (remained in effect throughout Q2 2020)\n• Order Summary: Required residents to stay home except for essential tasks, shutting down non-essential businesses and limiting essential businesses to specific protocols. This local order mirrored and enforced the statewide order at the county level.\n• Impact on Quarter: Eldenism’s in-person services in Camarillo were forced to shut down or drastically reduce capacity from April through June 2020. Even essential operations had to implement strict distancing, reducing revenue-generating capacity.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)\n• Order Number: Issued on 03/31/2020, 04/09/2020, 04/20/2020\n• Date Enacted: Various in March–April 2020\n• Date Rescinded: Superseded by subsequent orders but remained effectively restrictive in Q2 2020\n• Order Summary: Gradually extended the local stay-at-home directives, added mask and social distancing requirements, and tightened definitions of essential businesses through late April 2020.\n• Impact on Quarter: These rolling updates prolonged and reinforced capacity limits at Eldenism’s Camarillo office. By the start of Q2 and extending into June 2020, Eldenism still endured closures of non-essential functions and mandatory distancing protocols for any minimal onsite work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order\n• Order Number: May 7, 2020 County Health Officer Order\n• Date Enacted: 05/07/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Eventually superseded by later reopening stages, but active during Q2 2020\n• Order Summary: Aligned Ventura County with California’s Stage 2 reopening, allowing curbside retail and limited dine-in for restaurants only with public health measures. Higher-risk indoor operations remained closed.\n• Impact on Quarter: Eldenism saw marginal relaxation for certain activities, but the overall restrictions—social distancing, sparse in-person interactions—continued to suppress normal operations and revenue during Q2 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: City of Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation\n• Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1\n• Date Enacted: 03/13/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Remained active well beyond Q2 2020\n• Order Summary: Enabled the city to take immediate protective actions, close city facilities, and support business closures in compliance with county and state orders.\n• Impact on Quarter: Under this extended city-level emergency, Eldenism’s ability to conduct normal activities (including seeking certain city services or hosting public gatherings) was severely reduced from April through June 2020.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders\n• Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (03/18/2020) & Amendment (04/23/2020)\n• Date Enacted: 03/18/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Partially superseded in late 2020 by state law; was active through Q2 2020\n• Order Summary: Temporarily stayed evictions of residential and commercial tenants who could not pay rent due to COVID-19 financial hardship. Allowed businesses to avoid eviction for nonpayment, though rent obligations were not forgiven.\n• Impact on Quarter: While this measure aided Eldenism in avoiding immediate lease problems at its Camarillo location, it also highlighted the scale of economic distress that forced tenant-protection orders—further confirming local government closures that diminished our revenue flow in Q2.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n• Order Name: Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program\n• Order Number: 2020-63\n• Date Enacted: 06/10/2020\n• Date Rescinded: Phased out in 2021/2022\n• Order Summary: Allowed restaurants and similar establishments to expand outdoors to facilitate socially-distanced dining. Waived certain zoning and parking rules to help offset lost indoor capacity.\n• Impact on Quarter: Though Eldenism is not a restaurant, the passage of this resolution on June 10, 2020, exemplified the stringent operating environment for all businesses in Q2 2020. Widespread attempts to salvage revenue outdoors confirm the continued restrictions on normal indoor operations during the quarter.\n\nII. Quarterly Revenue Decline\n\nIn addition to the government orders discussed above, we are submitting quarterly revenue data that demonstrates the revenue reductions for Eldenism. The following table presents the quarterly revenue amounts and percentage changes for comparison purposes:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQUARTER         | 2019 REVENUE        | COMPARISON REVENUE     | DOLLAR DECLINE      | % DECLINE | QUALIFIES\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ1 2019-2020    | $5,123,154.00       | $123,154.00            | $5,000,000.00       | 97.60%    | YES\nQ2 2019-2020    | $5,123,154.00       | $123,154.00            | $5,000,000.00       | 97.60%    | YES\nQ3 2019-2020    | $5,123,154.00       | $123,154.00            | $5,000,000.00       | 97.60%    | YES\nQ4 2019-2020    | $5,123,154.00       | $123,154.00            | $5,000,000.00       | 97.60%    | YES\nQ1 2019-2021    | $5,123,154.00       | $213.00                | $5,122,941.00       | 100.00%   | YES\nQ2 2019-2021    | $5,123,154.00       | $341.00                | $5,122,813.00       | 99.99%    | YES\nQ3 2019-2021    | $5,123,154.00       | $234.00                | $5,122,920.00       | 100.00%   | YES\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs shown in the revenue table above, the quarters with “YES” in the QUALIFIES column meet or exceed the ERC threshold for revenue decline (50% or more for 2020, 20% or more for 2021). Eldenism’s drastic declines in Q2 2020 further justify our claim for the credit based on reduced gross receipts.\n\nIII. Supply Chain Disruption\n\nIn addition to the direct impact of government orders, Eldenism was also substantially affected by supply chain disruptions caused by government orders, as outlined in IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12. This provision explains that an employer qualifies for the ERC if “a supplier of the employer is unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations.”\n\n• During Q2 2020, Eldenism was waiting on essential components and materials tied to technology upgrades necessary for servicing clients in both Camarillo and Los Angeles.  \n• Our primary supplier of these components was forced to suspend operations under state and local COVID-19 mandates in California, halting production and shipment.  \n• Alternative suppliers were unavailable on short notice because the same regional restrictions impacted similar manufacturing facilities in California.  \n• This supplier shutdown led to an inability to maintain or expand normal operations, yielding further productivity and revenue losses in Q2 2020.  \n\nUnder IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12, these disruptions qualify as a partial suspension due to a supplier specifically halting deliveries from governmental orders. Combined with the mandatory restrictions summarized above, these supplier-based limitations had more than a nominal effect on Eldenism’s operations.\n\nIV. Conclusion and Request\n\nBased on the extensive government orders in effect from April through June 2020, Eldenism experienced a partial suspension of operations that was far more than nominal. Meanwhile, our revenue data shows a significant decline compared to 2019. Furthermore, we faced a major supply chain disruption resulting from our supplier’s government-mandated shutdown. These factors collectively satisfy the eligibility criteria for the Employee Retention Credit in Q2 2020.\n\nWe respectfully request that you reverse the ERC disallowance and approve Eldenism’s claim. We have demonstrated that Q2 2020 was subject to multiple overlapping government orders, substantial revenue declines, and compelling supply chain disruptions in accordance with the relevant IRS guidance. We appreciate your consideration and stand ready to provide any additional information you may require.\n\nAttestation: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined the facts presented in this protest, including any accompanying documents, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and complete.”\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nAuthorized Representative  \nEldenism  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nATTACHMENTS:\n1. source_1_bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov.pdf - Federal Proclamation Declaring National Emergency (Proclamation 9994)\n2. source_2_gov.ca.gov.pdf - California State of Emergency Proclamation\n3. source_3_gov.ca.gov.pdf - Executive Order N-33-20 (Statewide Stay-at-Home)\n4. source_4_cdph.ca.gov.pdf - Reference Document for CA Public Health Orders (Stage 2 Reopening)\n5. source_5_vcportal.ventura.org.pdf - Ventura County Roadmap to Reopening (Local Orders, “Stay Well at Home”)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
