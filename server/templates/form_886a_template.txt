Business: [BUSINESS_NAME]  
EIN: [EIN]  
Location: [LOCATION]  
Date: [CURRENT_DATE]

1. Issue  
Determine whether [BUSINESS_NAME] qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit based solely on the full or partial suspension of its operations due to COVID‑19 government orders over the periods [TIME_PERIODS]. This analysis specifically addresses the disallowance reason that [DISALLOWANCE_REASON] by documenting that, in fact, multiple orders were enacted that directly limited business operations, including the effect of supply chain disruptions caused by these orders (if applicable).

2. Facts  
[BUSINESS_NAME] is a [BUSINESS_TYPE] engaged in [DETAILED_BUSINESS_DESCRIPTION] located in [LOCATION]. The company provides [SPECIFIC_SERVICES_OR_PRODUCTS] to [CLIENT_BASE] in the [INDUSTRY_SECTOR] industry. The company's primary operations include [PRIMARY_BUSINESS_OPERATIONS], utilizing [EQUIPMENT/FACILITIES] and employing staff who perform [KEY_JOB_FUNCTIONS].

The ERC claim is based on the impact of COVID-19 government orders that resulted in a full or partial suspension of operations during the following quarters:
[LIST_OF_QUARTERS]

For each of the applicable quarters, official government orders were issued at the federal, state, and local levels that directly mandated operational restrictions, enforced capacity limits, required health and safety protocols, and/or disrupted critical supply chains, which reduced operational capacity.

3. Law  
The Employee Retention Credit, as set forth under Section 2301 of the CARES Act and interpreted in IRS Notice 2021-20, permits an eligible employer to claim the credit if its operations were either fully or partially suspended by an order from a governmental authority.

Section 2301 of the CARES Act, P.L. 116-136, 134 Stat. 281, enacted on March 27, 2020, provides for an employee retention credit for eligible employers that pay qualified wages, including certain health plan expenses, to some or all employees after March 12, 2020, and before January 1, 2021.

The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (Relief Act), enacted as Division EE of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182, on December 27, 2020, amended section 2301 to expand eligibility and extend the application of the employee retention credit to qualified wages paid after December 31, 2020, and before July 1, 2021.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP), P.L. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4 (March 11, 2021), enacted section 3134 of the Internal Revenue Code, providing for the ERC for calendar quarters beginning after June 30, 2021, for wages paid through December 31, 2021. This was later modified by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to terminate the ERC retroactively for all businesses other than recovery startup businesses.

IRS Notice 2021-20 provides guidance on "Eligible Employers." An employer may be considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations if more than a nominal portion of its business operations are suspended by a governmental order. The safe harbor for "more than nominal" impact is met when the governmental restrictions reduce business operations by at least 10%.

Official guidance clearly states that even if a business is classified as essential, it may still qualify for the ERC if government orders directly impose limitations on its operations. Per Notice 2021-20, Q/A #11, an essential business can experience a partial suspension if, under the facts and circumstances, more than a nominal portion of its business operations are suspended by a governmental order.

Additionally, IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12 states: "If a supplier of the employer is unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations, and the employer is unable to procure such critical goods or materials from an alternative supplier, the employer may be considered to have a full or partial suspension of operations."

4. Argument  
The evidence provided below demonstrates that, for the periods claimed, [BUSINESS_NAME] was subject to multiple government orders that imposed restrictions resulting in a partial suspension of its operations. Each government order is set forth in the exact required format:

[GOVERNMENT_ORDERS_SECTION]

5. Conclusion  
Based on the documented COVID‑19 government orders, [BUSINESS_NAME] experienced a qualified partial suspension of operations during [TIME_PERIODS]. The cumulative impact of these orders meets the requirements under IRS Notice 2021-20 for claiming the Employee Retention Credit. Therefore, the disallowance reason stating [DISALLOWANCE_REASON] is not accurate, and [BUSINESS_NAME] qualifies for the ERC for the applicable quarters based on the government orders approach.
