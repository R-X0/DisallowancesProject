REVENUE DECLINE PRESENTATION FORMAT:
When including revenue decline information, use the following tabular format:

1. Create a header paragraph that introduces the revenue data:
"In addition to the government orders discussed above, we are submitting quarterly revenue data that demonstrates the revenue reductions for [BUSINESS_NAME]. The following table presents the quarterly revenue amounts and percentage changes for comparison purposes."

2. Present the comprehensive revenue data in a clear, table-like format showing ALL quarters with available data. For each quarter, include:
   - The quarter being compared (e.g., "Q1 2019-2020")
   - 2019 baseline revenue
   - Comparison period revenue (2020 or 2021)
   - Dollar amount of decline
   - Percentage decline
   - Whether the quarter qualifies for ERC based on revenue decline

3. After the table, add a summary paragraph:
"As shown in the revenue table above, the quarters with 'YES' in the QUALIFIES column meet the ERC threshold for revenue decline (50%+ for 2020, 20%+ for 2021). These revenue reductions, combined with the impact of government orders described earlier, provide substantiation for our ERC claim."

DO NOT USE PHRASES like "audited figures" or "exact amounts" or "EXACT" revenues, as these values have not been audited. Simply present the data as reported by the business.

IMPORTANT: Include ALL quarters where data is available in the table, not just the qualifying quarters. This comprehensive presentation provides better context for the ERC claim.`;

SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION ANALYSIS:
This protest should emphasize that the business was ALSO affected by supply chain disruptions caused by government orders.

1. Include a dedicated section on supply chain disruption with these components:
   * Cite IRS Notice 2021-20, Question & Answer #12 which specifically covers supply chain disruption qualification
   * Identify which critical materials or components were unavailable due to supplier shutdowns
   * Document specific supplier shutdowns caused by government mandates
   * Explain why alternative suppliers were not available during the claimed period
   * Show how these supply chain issues directly caused operational limitations

2. Begin the supply chain section with this paragraph (modify as needed):
"In addition to the direct impact of government orders, [BUSINESS_NAME] was also substantially affected by supply chain disruptions caused by government orders as described in IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12. This provision states that an employer qualifies for the ERC when 'a supplier of the employer is unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations.'"

3. Emphasize that these supply chain disruptions were sufficient to qualify for the ERC under this provision.`;
