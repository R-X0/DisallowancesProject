SOURCES:
1. https://full-url-to-source.gov - Brief description of source
2. https://another-source-url.gov - Another description
...etc

Requirements for your SOURCES section:
1. ONLY include primary sources (government websites)
2. Include the FULL URL to each source (not just the domain)
3. Number each source sequentially starting from 1
4. Include EXACTLY the URLs you're referencing in your document
5. Each source MUST be on its own line with its number, URL, and description
6. DO NOT link to search pages or homepages - link to the SPECIFIC document pages
7. Include ALL government orders you've referenced in your document
8. Format as shown above with no additional text or explanations
9. Make sure each URL is separated from its description with a space, dash, and space (" - ")
10. DO NOT abbreviate or shorten URLs - include the complete URL

2. ${businessInfo.businessWebsite ? `Research the business website (${businessInfo.businessWebsite}) to understand their specific operations.` : 'Research typical operations for a business of this type and NAICS code.'}
3. DO NOT include the phrase "Based on the name, address, and common operations in this area".

7. Provide concrete details about what the business actually does, not assumptions about typical businesses.

   â€¢ Order Summary: [3-4 sentence description quoting the EXACT language of restrictions]
   â€¢ Impact on Quarter: [Detailed explanation of how this specifically affected the business]

   CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPACT ON QUARTER:
   - ALWAYS show how the order SIGNIFICANTLY disrupted operations
   - AVOID phrases like "minor adjustments," "slight modifications," or "continued full-capacity operations"
   - EMPHASIZE real business limitations, reduced efficiency, capacity constraints, workflow disruptions
   - QUANTIFY impact whenever possible (e.g., "reduced capacity by approximately 25%")
   - CONNECT the restrictions directly to reduced operational capability
   - NEVER suggest that operations continued as normal or with minimal impact
   
   - Organize orders chronologically by quarter
   - Ensure each claimed quarter has documented orders
   - For controlled groups, include orders from ALL relevant jurisdictions: ${businessLocations.join(', ')}
   - ${(timePeriodsFormatted.includes('Q3 2021') || timePeriodsFormatted.includes('3rd Quarter 2021')) ? 'For Q3 2021, ensure you include federal orders like PROCLAMATION 9994, EXECUTIVE ORDER 14017, and CDC Delta variant guidance from July 2021.' : ''}

2. Present the comprehensive revenue data in a clear, table-like format showing ALL quarters with available data. For each quarter, include:
   - The quarter being compared (e.g., "Q1 2019-2020")
   - 2019 baseline revenue
   - Comparison period revenue (2020 or 2021)
   - Dollar amount of decline
   - Percentage decline
   - Whether the quarter qualifies for ERC based on revenue decline

3. After the table, add a summary paragraph:
"As shown in the revenue table above, the quarters with 'YES' in the QUALIFIES column meet the ERC threshold for revenue decline (50%+ for 2020, 20%+ for 2021). These revenue reductions, combined with the impact of government orders described earlier, provide substantiation for our ERC claim."

DO NOT USE PHRASES like "audited figures" or "exact amounts" or "EXACT" revenues, as these values have not been audited. Simply present the data as reported by the business.

   * Identify which critical materials or components were unavailable due to supplier shutdowns
   * Document specific supplier shutdowns caused by government mandates
   * Explain why alternative suppliers were not available during the claimed period
   * Show how these supply chain issues directly caused operational limitations

2. Begin the supply chain section with this paragraph (modify as needed):
"In addition to the direct impact of government orders, [BUSINESS_NAME] was also substantially affected by supply chain disruptions caused by government orders as described in IRS Notice 2021-20, Q/A #12. This provision states that an employer qualifies for the ERC when 'a supplier of the employer is unable to make deliveries of critical goods or materials due to a governmental order that causes the supplier to suspend its operations.'"
