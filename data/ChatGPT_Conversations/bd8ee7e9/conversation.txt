COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order number or identifying number, the name of the government order/proclamation, the date it was enacted and (if applicable) the date it was rescinded or superseded, along with a detailed summary describing the order’s provisions and its specific impact on businesses in Q3 2020. Additionally, possible reasons how Q3 2020 COVID orders would have affected businesses during that quarter are discussed.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (continued in effect and later terminated in 2023)
  – Rescinded By: Termination later by Congress (outside the 2020–2021 timeframe)
  – Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding and set the stage for subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it provided the legal framework that allowed state and local public health orders to be issued. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the national emergency context—federal financial support (such as stimulus aid) was available, even while strict state/local health orders continued to limit business operations. The ongoing national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic that ultimately forced sustained restrictions.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel (Travel-related)
  – Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order became effective February 1, 2021)
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022 via court order)
  – Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate
  – Summary: Although not a direct business closure order, this measure required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties as part of a federal effort to protect travelers. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 this order had no direct effect (since it began in 2021), but it reflects the federal response into early 2021. Federal action during Q3 2020 mainly focused on declaring and maintaining the national emergency that empowered state and local restrictions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID-19 State of Emergency”
  – Order Number: (No separate number; this was declared by the Governor)
  – Date Enacted: March 4, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active; formally ended in February 2023)
  – Rescinded By: Ended by a later proclamation (beyond 2021)
  – Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s declaration of a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 empowered state authorities to mobilize resources, suspend certain laws, and later issue stringent lockdown measures. This emergency enabled public health authorities to impose orders that affected business operations—limiting capacities, closing “non-essential” businesses, etc. In Q3 2020 the state of emergency underpinned all COVID-19 restrictions statewide, meaning that businesses were still subject to severe limitations although some had begun to reopen under modified guidelines.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‐at‐Home’ Order”
  – Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (order became effective immediately)
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021
  – Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 issued on June 11, 2021 terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home order and phased reopening orders superseded it.
  – Summary: This very broad and sweeping lockdown order required all Californians to remain at home except for essential activities and employment in critical sectors. It forced “non-essential” businesses (including dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or operate at minimal capacity while only “essential” businesses could keep functioning. Although by Q3 2020 the direct mandate had evolved (with gradual reopening under revised rules), many Camarillo businesses were still functioning under severe capacity restrictions or partial closures that originated in this order. The order’s “until further notice” language meant that many sectors were still limited in summer, directly affecting revenue and service levels.

  Link (example PDF of the order): https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2) Order”
  – Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under EO N‑60‑20)
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)
  – Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021) formally replaced the May 7 order.
  – Summary: As the state neared the end of its initial lockdown phase and COVID-19 case rates began to stabilize in the spring, this order relaxed the strict stay-at-home measures to allow lower-risk businesses (such as retail stores offering curbside pickup and certain manufacturing and supply chain operations for these retail businesses) to reopen. In Camarillo by Q3 2020 this Stage 2 order had helped many low-risk businesses to reopen. However, the summer surge in COVID-19 during July forced a rollback of some of these reopenings. As a result, many Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June were forced to scale down operations (for instance, indoor dining remained closed and only outdoor or take-away service was permitted). This rapid back-and-forth resulting from the order and its modifications is a key reason why Q3 2020 was so challenging for local businesses.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021
  – Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) replaced these closures with a color-tier system, and subsequently the “Beyond Blueprint” order ended all remaining restrictions.
  – Summary: In response to a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, the state ordered a rollback of many reopened sectors. This meant that indoor dining was closed (restaurants were forced to offer take-out or outdoor-only service), bars, breweries, movie theaters, and many other sectors were shut down or forced to move outdoors. For Camarillo businesses that had experienced a brief reopening in May/June, this July order meant a second round of closures and restrictions during summer, resulting in further revenue loss. It was a direct response to rising case numbers and was intended as an emergency measure to quickly “pull the brakes” on open indoor gatherings.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System
  – Order Number: This was a State Health Officer Order issued on August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)
  – Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (retired under the “Beyond Blueprint” Order)
  – Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021) terminated the tier system.
  – Summary: This framework replaced the “blanket” closing orders with a risk-based color-coded tier system. Counties were assigned to tiers (Purple = widespread risk; Red = substantial risk; Orange = moderate; Yellow = minimal risk) based on local case numbers and positivity rates. Ventura County (which includes Camarillo) entered the system in the Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that although the earlier July order rolls were softened, many sectors still faced significant limitations (such as restricted indoor operations for restaurants, gyms remaining closed, etc.). In Q3 2020, businesses were operating under this new framework—which promised gradual reopening when conditions improved—which explains why many Camarillo establishments remained heavily restricted during that quarter.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order
  – Order Details: Executive Order N‑07‑21 and the corresponding State Health Officer Order
  – Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)
  – Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order ended all previous business closures/restrictions)
  – Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded earlier orders.
  – Summary: This order marked the full reopening of California by ending the Stay-at-Home Order and the Blueprint tier system. It lifted capacity limits, social distancing requirements, and other COVID-19 restrictions on businesses. Although it was issued in mid-2021, by comparison the fact that it took until then shows that Q3 2020 remained a time of strict and evolving restrictions. Businesses in Q3 2020 did not enjoy these relaxed rules; instead, they had to contend with the repeated imposition and rollback of restrictions until conditions finally improved mid-2021.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – Declaration of Local Health Emergency
  – Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (finally ended in 2022)
  – Rescinded By: Later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution (after our period)
  – Summary: Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. Although the declaration itself did not impose direct restrictions on business operations, it provided the legal basis for all subsequent county health orders and helped coordinate Colorado’s (and the region’s) response. Throughout 2020—including Q3 2020—this locally declared emergency supported enforcement of state orders and additional county-specific rules that directly affected business operations. The county retained this emergency status because COVID-19 remained a significant risk locally.

  Link: (Example reference) https://www.ventura.org/

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions
  – Order Date: March 17, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 (and subsequently repealed/replaced by later orders)
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s Order of March 20, 2020
  – Summary: Before the statewide mandate, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions where vulnerable residents were directed to shelter in place and non-essential businesses (such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, and theaters) were closed. This early order set an aggressive local tone. By Q3 2020 its specific provisions had been replaced by staged reopening orders, yet the proactive local stance underscored the county’s willingness to impose strict measures if needed throughout the pandemic’s course.

  Link: (For example, see official Ventura County COVID–19 resources)

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)
  – Order Date: March 20, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in alignment with state reopening; officially ended local restrictions on June 15, 2021)
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on June 15, 2021, which ended remaining local mandates
  – Summary: Ventura County’s order required all residents to remain at home except for essential activities and dictated that non-essential businesses shut down or dramatically limit on-site operations. This local lockdown forced nearly all Camarillo businesses to cease in-person operations unless listed as essential (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and certain healthcare services). In Q3 2020, even though the strict “stay–at–home” order was modified to allow partial reopenings, many of its strict core conditions still affected business operations (e.g., capacity limits were still enforced) as the county continued to operate under a framework developed in March 2020.

  Link: Official Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” Order page (for example, see https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC)

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)
  – Multiple Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order on May 7, 2020, which replaced the earlier orders with state-aligned regulations
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020
  – Summary: During the spring of 2020, Ventura County regularly updated its public health orders by extending the “Stay Well at Home” period, adding prohibitions on all gatherings (outside a single household) and enforcing strict social distancing protocols for essential businesses. Though these detailed orders did not directly apply in Q3 2020, they laid the groundwork for how businesses would be required to operate when permitted to reopen later that year. The gradual extension and tightening in the spring explain why Q3 2020 reopenings were marked by enduring social distancing and other safety measures, affecting customer throughput and operating costs.

  Link: (See Ventura County COVID–19 resources for historical orders)

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening
  – Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint Order on August 31, 2020 and later by complete reopening orders in June 2021
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 and then the June 15, 2021 state order ending tier restrictions
  – Summary: In early May 2020—as the state signaled the beginning of reopening—Ventura County issued the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order. This order repealed some of the stricter spring lockdowns and permitted certain businesses (including curbside retail, manufacturing supporting retail, and later dine–in restaurants at reduced capacity) to reopen under specific safety protocols. For businesses in Q3 2020, this set the stage for a cautious economic revival. Yet because COVID-19 cases surged again in summer 2020, many restrictions were quickly reimposed in July. This back–and–forth had a major impact on Camarillo businesses, which opened partially under strict guidelines only to have many operations rolled back in mid-summer.

  Link: (For details, see Ventura County “Safely Reopening” documents such as on https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC)

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach and Public Gathering Closure
  – Order Date: Announced on June 30, 2020 (for July 3–5, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Automatically expired on July 6, 2020 (order applied only for the Independence Day weekend)
  – Rescinded By: The order expired as scheduled
  – Summary: In anticipation of large holiday gatherings during the Independence Day weekend and amid rising COVID-19 cases, Ventura County issued an order closing beaches and beach parking lots for that weekend. Although Camarillo is inland, the order negatively impacted the broader region’s tourism and commerce. In Q3 2020, such targeted orders not only reduced visitor traffic in the coastal region near Camarillo but also signaled the readiness of authorities to rapidly impose local measures if case spikes were observed.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county transitioned to a tier system (later changes occurred in December 2020 and January 2021)
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020 allowed indoor operations to resume for certain sectors
  – Summary: Following the state’s July 13 order to rollback reopenings, Ventura County issued a corresponding local order that re-closed internet–sensitive sectors such as gyms, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), places of worship, and some indoor dining operations. This reimposition meant that many Camarillo businesses that had briefly reopened in early summer were forced to close again or shift to outdoor-only service. The renewed restrictions in July significantly reduced business revenues during Q3 2020, with many establishments not reopening indoor operations until conditions allowed in the fall.

  Link: (Refer to Ventura County Health Officer documents available on vcportal.ventura.org)

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020
  – Order Date: October 6, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Effectively remained until January 25, 2021 when a Regional Stay-At-Home Order (and later a return to Purple tier) took effect; ultimately state orders ended tier restrictions on June 15, 2021
  – Rescinded By: Superseded first by the December 2020 Regional Stay-At-Home Order and later fully nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 order
  – Summary: With improved COVID–19 case numbers in early fall, Ventura County moved from the Purple tier to the Red tier under the state’s Blueprint framework. The October 6 order allowed certain businesses such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services to resume indoor operations under strict guidelines. Although this order provided a measure of relief for Camarillo businesses at the tail end of Q3 (particularly in September), many restrictions were imposed again in December when COVID cases surged. Thus, while the Red Tier order was the first sign that things might soon improve, its timing meant that businesses in mid-Q3 continued to operate under very heavy restrictions.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)
  – Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 and subsequent extensions
  – Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial passing on March 31, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Residential protections were superseded on September 30, 2020 via the state’s COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088); commercial moratorium in Ventura County was extended only through September 30, 2020
  – Rescinded By: For residential tenants, by California AB 3088; for commercial, by local expiration
  – Summary: In an effort to help both residents and small–business commercial tenants facing financial hardship, Ventura County issued an eviction moratorium that temporarily prevented landlords from evicting tenants who failed to pay rent due to COVID–19 economic impacts. This provided critical relief, as a Camarillo business struggling with reduced income could defer rent payments without immediate risk of eviction. Although the moratorium did not forgive rent, it offered a temporary lifeline that helped many businesses weather the extraordinary economic pressure of Q3 2020.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)
  – Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1; City Council Resolution 20-36 ratified on March 13, 2020
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (local emergency remained until lifted in 2022)
  – Rescinded By: Later City Council resolution ending the COVID–19 emergency (in April 2022)
  – Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency through the City Manager (EOC Director) and City Council. The proclamation activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and allowed rapid deployment of local measures such as closing city facilities and cancelling public events. For businesses, the maintained local emergency meant that the city could continue to enact rules (including those affecting permits and public events) and provide regulatory relief. It also served to alert residents to the seriousness of the situation, influencing consumer behavior throughout Q3 2020.

  Link: (For additional details, review past Camarillo city press releases such as those on https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases)

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders
  – Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and its amendment on April 23, 2020
  – Date Enacted: March 18, 2020; amended April 23, 2020
  – Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, later superseded on August 31, 2020 by the state’s Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088); any remaining commercial provisions ended when the local emergency was terminated in 2022
  – Rescinded By: AB 3088 for residential; local termination for commercial
  – Summary: To protect both residential and commercial tenants from immediate eviction due to COVID–19–related financial hardships, the City of Camarillo issued orders that halted evictions. This was especially important for small businesses operating in rental spaces within the city. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo business owners benefited from the prospect of deferring rent obligations, giving them time to adjust their operations amid reduced revenues. Although this order did not cancel rent, it prevented immediate losses of property that could have led to permanent business closures.

  Link: (For more information, see Camarillo City press releases and official documents—often found via Camarillo’s local government website)

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program
  – Date Enacted: Early June 2020 (approximately June 10, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Effectively expired around June 15, 2021 when indoor dining resumed fully; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency
  – Rescinded By: Sunset as COVID–19 capacity restrictions ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022
  – Summary: Recognizing that indoor dining had been severely restricted, the City of Camarillo adopted Resolution No. 2020-63 to waive certain zoning requirements and fees for restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. This allowed restaurants to serve customers outdoors when indoor service was not permitted. In Q3 2020, as many restaurants in Camarillo faced intermittent closures and capacity limits indoors, these outdoor dining allowances were vital for economic survival and provided an alternative revenue stream during challenging times.

• Additional Camarillo Measures – Miscellaneous Policies
  – Dates: Various (Spring to Summer 2020)
  – Summary: Beyond the above orders, the City of Camarillo also suspended late fees for business taxes, streamlined permit processes (moving them online), and promoted take-out dining campaigns to assist local restaurants. City code enforcement worked in coordination with Ventura County to ensure compliance with health orders. These measures, though not orders in themselves, were part of the overall COVID-19 response and affected how businesses adapted their operations during Q3 2020.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Analysis

For a “business” located in Camarillo, California, the combined federal, state, county, and city orders meant:
– In Q3 2020 many businesses were operating under uncertainty. While some sectors had partially reopened under Stage 2 and the Blueprint system, the reimposition of restrictions (e.g. the July 13 rollback order) meant that many operations were still limited.
– The state’s nationwide emergency and subsequent Stay-at-Home and reopening orders forced many “non-essential” businesses to close or operate at reduced capacity.
– Ventura County’s local orders further tightened restrictions – with additional local mandates, updates and targeted closures (such as the 4th of July beach closure and subsequent July rollback) that impacted business revenue.
– Camarillo’s local measures (including its own eviction moratorium and the outdoor dining program) provided critical economic relief even as overall consumer traffic decreased.
– The continual change—from strict lockdown to cautious reopening and then rollback amid surges—meant that Q3 2020 was marked by dramatic fluctuations and a uniquely challenging environment for local businesses.

All orders were enacted with the aim of protecting public health during an unprecedented crisis, but each also had immediate and cascading impacts on business operations, revenue, and planning throughout the third quarter of 2020.
