COVID Orders Business Impact

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”
  - Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
    [Reference: https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation]
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect during that period; the President continued it on February 24, 2021). It was later terminated by Congress in 2023 (outside our scope).
  - Rescinded By: Later termination by Congress (beyond the 2020–2021 timeframe).
  - Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it created the framework under which states and counties later imposed aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses operated under the conditions of an ongoing national emergency—which meant federal support (for example, through stimulus aid) was available, while strict local health orders (backed by that emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
  - Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)
  - Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside the 2020–2021 period).
  - Summary: With the change in presidential administration, federal mask requirements were imposed on interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and the CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. Although these mandates had little direct effect on Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020 (as they began in 2021), they reflect the continuing federal response into 2021. By mid‑2021, as vaccines were deployed, the federal focus shifted to safe operating protocols rather than blanket closures, while during Q3 2020 local and state orders were the primary drivers of business restrictions.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”
  - Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)
  - Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
    [Reference: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death]
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout that period; it was formally ended on February 28, 2023, which is outside the 2020–2021 scope).
  - Rescinded By: Ended later by Governor’s proclamation in 2023.
  - Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, due to COVID‑19. This emergency status empowered the Governor and state health authorities to take sweeping actions affecting businesses, including suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns. In Q3 2020, the ongoing state of emergency underpinned all subsequent orders and provided the legal authority for continued public health measures affecting businesses. This legal framework justified the restrictions businesses faced during that quarter.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”
  - Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
    [Reference: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as]
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
    [Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) terminated the statewide Stay‑at‑Home order effective 6/15/2021; see also https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the ]
  - Rescinded By: The later phased reopening orders and the Beyond Blueprint Order.
  - Summary: This was California’s sweeping lockdown order implemented at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all residents to remain at home—except for essential needs and work in critical sectors—with “non‑essential” businesses forced to close or to operate minimally. By Q3 2020, while the order had evolved to allow gradual reopenings, many Camarillo businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, etc.) continued to operate under strict limitations derived from this original order. The force of this order, which remained “until further notice,” is a major reason why many businesses operated at reduced capacity or remained closed in Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”
  - Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under EO N‑60‑20)  
    [Reference: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=with%20Executive%20Order%20N-60-20,finally%20an%20easing%20of%20final ]
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
    [Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order issued June 11, 2021 (see https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)]
  - Rescinded By: The new order that formally terminated the stay‑at‑home and the tier framework.
  - Summary: In May 2020, as case rates plateaued, California’s Public Health Officer modified the strict stay‑at‑home order to allow “Stage 2” reopenings. Lower‑risk businesses (for example, retail stores offering curbside pickup and supply chain operations) were allowed to reopen; however, higher‑risk categories (such as dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 reopening paved the way for some restaurants and retailers to reopen, albeit under strict conditions. However, the later summer surge meant that many of these reopenings were quickly reversed, contributing to the challenging conditions in Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  - Order Date: July 13, 2020  
    [Reference: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text= of the State Public Health Officer Order,]
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021.
  - Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order.
  - Summary: In response to a sharp summer surge in COVID‑19 cases, California re‑imposed restrictions on sectors that had reopened earlier. This July 13 order closed indoor operations (such as indoor dining in restaurants, bars, movie theaters, museums, and certain personal care services) on a statewide basis. As a result, many Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May or June were forced to close or operate only outdoors or via take‑out by July. This sudden rollback significantly reduced revenues and operations for many local businesses in Q3 2020, reflecting the state’s attempt to “hit the emergency brake” in response to rising cases.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color‑Tier Reopening System”
  - Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (issued August 28, 2020)
  - Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)  
    [Reference: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease ]
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
    [Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021]
  - Rescinded By: The June 15, 2021 reopening order which ended most business restrictions.
  - Summary: California’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy established a color‑coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID‑19 metrics to dictate which business sectors could operate and under what conditions. Ventura County, and therefore Camarillo, was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier as of August 31, 2020—meaning that while some businesses could operate indoors with limited capacity (for example, retail stores), many sectors including indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters were not allowed to operate indoors. Although this framework later allowed for gradual easing as conditions improved, during Q3 2020 most Camarillo businesses faced heavy restrictions under the most severe tier, which directly contributed to the challenging business environment of that quarter.

• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
  - Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; effective December 6, 2020 for the Southern California region)  
    [Reference: https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=Late%20Friday%2C%20December%204%2C%202020%2C,the%20day%20before ]
  - Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
    [Reference: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority ]
  - Rescinded By: A statewide announcement lifting the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order (January 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved.
  - Summary: Late in 2020, in response to an alarming winter surge (with ICU capacity dropping below 15%), California implemented a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order for Southern California. This order mandated the closure of many business sectors—including the closure of outdoor dining, personal care services, movie theaters, museums, and retail at reduced capacity—in counties falling under the directive. While the order itself took effect in Q4 2020, it underscored the fragile state of reopening; even though Q3 2020 was not directly under this order, its looming possibility influenced business caution and planning in Q3.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay‑at‑Home/Tiers
  - Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021; effective June 15, 2021)
    [Reference: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the ]
    and
    [Reference: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order ]
  - Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (with effective reopening on June 15, 2021)
  - Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order itself serves to rescind all previous business restrictions)
  - Rescinded By: This new order terminated the earlier Stay‑at‑Home order and phased out the Blueprint system.
  - Summary: These orders marked the official full reopening of California on June 15, 2021. They ended capacity limits, physical distancing requirements, and the county tier system. For Q3 2020, the significance of this order is in contrast: while businesses in Q3 2020 juggled evolving restrictions, the complete lifting of such measures did not occur until mid‑2021. This highlights the prolonged nature of business constraints during Q3 2020 due to an ongoing public health emergency.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  - Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
    [Reference: (from official Ventura County sources)]
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained active; it was ultimately ended in 2022 but that is outside our timeframe)
  - Rescinded By: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID‑19 emergency (in 2022).
  - Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency. This declaration did not by itself impose business restrictions but provided the legal basis for subsequent health orders. Throughout 2020, including Q3 2020, the emergency status allowed the county to enforce state rules and impose additional local restrictions affecting businesses in Camarillo.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  - Order Date: March 17, 2020  
    [Reference: (from Ventura County documents)]
  - Date Rescinded: This order was superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order and later repealed by subsequent orders.
  - Rescinded By: The Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” order issued March 20, 2020.
  - Summary: Prior to the statewide stay‑at‑home mandate, Ventura County issued an order on March 17, 2020 directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordering the closure of certain businesses and public facilities such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, and movie theaters. Although this order was quickly integrated into broader mandates, its early aggressive stance set the tone for local restrictions throughout the pandemic. Its legacy is seen in the continued readiness of the county to impose strict measures during Q3 2020.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay‑Home Order”
  - Order Date: March 20, 2020  
    [Reference: (from Ventura County documents; e.g., https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/)]
  - Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (with local restrictions effectively ending when the state reopened on June 15, 2021)
    [Reference: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf]
  - Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer Order dated June 15, 2021.
  - Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities and forced nearly all non‑essential businesses (including most in Camarillo) to cease in‑person operations. Although later modified to allow partial reopenings, the foundational framework of restrictive capacity limits and closures originated here and continued to affect business operations well into Q3 2020. The order remained a key legal and practical basis for restrictions during the pandemic in Ventura County.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
  - Order Dates: March 31, 2020 (extension), April 9, 2020 (banning gatherings and instituting safety protocols), and April 20, 2020 (further extension)  
    [Reference: (from Ventura County sources, e.g., https://aagla.org/)]
  - Date Rescinded: These were superseded in May 2020 when the county issued a “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap.
  - Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order issued on May 7, 2020.
  - Summary: Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County updated its Stay Well at Home order by extending its duration and incorporating stricter social distancing rules (including bans on gatherings) and safety protocols. Although these specific orders were later replaced by a reopening framework, the operational changes they introduced (such as capacity restrictions and distancing) continued to guide business practice into Q3 2020.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
  - Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020  
    [Reference May 7: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/ ; May 20 amendment details also from Ventura County guidance]
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint (effective August 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening order.
  - Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer Order dated August 31, 2020 (aligning with the state tier system) and ultimately the June 15, 2021 order.
  - Summary: In May 2020, Ventura County issued a “Safely Reopening” order that replaced earlier strict stay‑at‑home measures, allowing certain businesses to reopen under strict protocols. This enabled lower‑risk businesses (such as curbside retail and manufacturing supporting retail) to resume operations—with some restaurants allowed to offer dine‑in at limited capacity. In Q3 2020, these orders meant that many local businesses were open but under stringent safety guidelines, and when COVID‑19 cases surged again in July, many were forced to scale back or close indoor operations.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  - Order Date: Announced on June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
    [Reference: https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%208%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93%20On ]
  - Date Rescinded: The order expired after July 5, 2020.
  - Rescinded By: The order expired according to its set terms.
  - Summary: In anticipation of large gatherings during the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County ordered beaches and beach parking lots to be closed for the July 4, 2020 weekend. Although a short‑term measure, it temporarily curtailed tourism and related commerce, affecting local business revenues during a period that would normally be busy for coastal areas adjacent to Camarillo.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  - Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
    [Reference: (from Ventura County Health Officer orders, e.g., https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf)]
  - Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved to a less restrictive tier (Red tier)
  - Rescinded By: A Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020 that allowed indoor operations for gyms, churches, and personal care services.
  - Summary: In line with the state’s July 13 order, Ventura County issued a corresponding local order that re‑closed indoor operations for many sectors, such as gyms, fitness centers, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and places of worship. Consequently, many Camarillo businesses in these sectors had to shut down indoor operations again, leading to significant revenue losses during Q3 2020. When conditions improved in October and the county shifted to the Red tier, some of these restrictions were relaxed, offering a glimpse of reopening after a challenging summer.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  - Order Date: October 6, 2020  
    [Reference: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,]
  - Date Rescinded: In January 2021 (when the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was implemented and then later by the June 15, 2021 state reopening)
  - Rescinded By: Superseded by the December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and subsequent state orders.
  - Summary: With improved COVID‑19 metrics in early October 2020, Ventura County moved to the Red tier, which allowed certain businesses to reopen indoors under strict conditions. This order reversed some of the severe restrictions imposed in July 2020—allowing, for example, gyms, churches, and personal care services to resume indoor operations at limited capacity. Although coming at the end of Q3, it was the first sign of easing after a painful summer closure for many Camarillo businesses, even though the improvement was short‑lived as winter surges ensued later.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  - Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)
  - Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
    [Reference: (from Ventura County documents, e.g., https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=)]
  - Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, through September 30, 2020 (with extensions later allowed by the Governor for some areas, but Ventura’s local records indicate an expiration in September 2020); for residential evictions, protections were replaced by state law (from September 1, 2020 via AB 3088).
  - Rescinded By: California’s COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential tenants and local decisions for commercial tenants.
  - Summary: Ventura County enacted an eviction moratorium to protect both residential and small‑business commercial tenants from eviction due to financial hardships caused by the pandemic. This measure provided critical relief for Camarillo businesses facing lost revenues, allowing them to defer rent payments without the immediate risk of eviction. Although temporary and not a forgiveness of rent, it helped many businesses remain in place during Q3 2020.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  - Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (Emergency Proclamation)
  - Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
    (Ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36 on March 13, 2020)
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained in effect into 2021; it was lifted in 2022)
  - Rescinded By: A later City Council resolution ending the local COVID‑19 emergency (April 2022, outside our timeframe)
  - Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID‑19. This proclamation activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed the city to deploy rapid response measures, such as closing city facilities and canceling public events. The local emergency helped coordinate local responses that also affected businesses—for example, by influencing adjustments to permitting procedures and public space usage throughout Q3 2020.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  - Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (issued March 18, 2020) and an Amendment (issued April 23, 2020)
    [Reference: (from Camarillo city documents)]
  - Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial order), amended April 23, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law for residential tenants (effective September 2020) and ended with the local emergency (for any remaining commercial provisions)
  - Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (Tenant Relief Act) for residential tenants and later termination of the city emergency.
  - Summary: The City of Camarillo issued its own eviction moratorium to prevent evictions of both residential and commercial tenants unable to pay rent due to pandemic-related losses. This protection was particularly important for local businesses in Camarillo, helping them avoid displacement during Q3 2020 while they struggled with reduced revenues.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  - Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)
  - Date Rescinded: The provisions expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)
  - Rescinded By: Automatic sunset as local COVID‑19 restrictions were lifted and normal zoning rules resumed.
  - Summary: In an effort to help restaurants survive with indoor dining severely restricted, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020‑63. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and permit fees to allow restaurants to establish temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. In Q3 2020, when indoor dining was intermittently closed or limited, these outdoor setups allowed many restaurants to continue serving customers, softening the economic impact on these businesses. This innovative action was critical to supporting local dining establishments during a very difficult time.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
  - Dates: Various throughout spring to summer 2020
  - Summary: Beyond the major orders above, the City of Camarillo undertook additional actions to support local businesses during the pandemic. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, transitioning permit processes to online systems for construction projects, and promoting take‑out dining campaigns to bolster local restaurants. While not all of these were “orders” in the traditional sense, they formed part of the comprehensive COVID‑19 response framework that impacted business operations in Camarillo during Q3 2020.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Synthesis

All levels of government—from the federal government down to the City of Camarillo—issued a patchwork of emergency orders, proclamations, and regulations intended both to protect public health and to provide economic relief. For businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020, the combined effect was a confusing and challenging regulatory environment. Even as some sectors were allowed to reopen (albeit with severe limitations), sudden rollbacks (especially in July during the summer surge) forced many businesses to close or radically limit operations again. Measures such as eviction moratoria and the outdoor dining program offered essential, if temporary, relief amid ongoing uncertainty.
