Martin Motors of West Virginia – COVID‑19 Impact and ERC Eligibility

Martin Motors of West Virginia (operating as an Audi/Volkswagen dealership in Clarksburg, WV) was significantly impacted by the COVID‑19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021. The following sections summarize the dealership’s business operations and the government orders that affected those operations from Q2 2020 through Q3 2021. Finally, a Form 886-A style analysis is provided to support the dealership’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claims for that period, emphasizing eligibility due to government-ordered shutdowns and supply chain disruptions (rather than gross receipt reductions).

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Business Operations Overview

Martin Motors of West Virginia is a franchised automobile dealership offering both vehicle sales and service in the Clarksburg area. Key aspects of its operations include:

1. Sales Operations

• Showroom Sales: The primary revenue stream comes from in-person vehicle sales. Under normal conditions customers visit the showroom to view inventory, test drive, and complete purchases. However, during the COVID‑19 shutdowns in spring 2020—in particular under state stay‑at‑home orders—the normal showroom activity was halted. Customers were not allowed to visit in person (late Q1 through early Q2 2020). Even after formal restrictions eased, customer traffic remained below normal as people avoided public spaces.

• Impact on Sales Volume: The disruptions led to a sharp decline in vehicle sales during the affected periods. An owner in the WV auto dealer community remarked, “Business essentially stopped.” April 2020 sales were especially depressed due to showroom closure. Later in 2020 sales began recovering, but the dealership never immediately returned to pre‑pandemic volume. Industry reports noted that new vehicle deliveries across the U.S. fell by over 20% in Q1 2020 due to lockdowns.

2. Service Operations

• Essential Services: Martin Motors also operates a service center for vehicle maintenance and repairs. Auto repair was designated an essential business in West Virginia. Hence, the service department remained open during the lockdown—even while the showroom was closed. However, operations were modified for safety (curbside drop-off, enhanced cleaning, social distancing in waiting areas, and mandatory face coverings once those were required).

• Operational Capacity: Although the service center remained open, operations were scaled back. In the strictest period (late March through April 2020), many customers deferred non-urgent maintenance. Additionally, in the event of any COVID‑19 exposure among staff, brief shutdowns for deep cleaning were mandated as per local health directives. Such interruptions sometimes lasted one or two days.

3. Staffing and Employment Impacts

• Workforce Size: The dealership employs dozens of staff across sales, service, parts, and administration. With the onset of the pandemic, the business was forced to scale back operations, impacting staffing.

• Furloughs/Reductions: During the spring 2020 shutdown, Martin Motors furloughed a substantial portion of its employees in the sales department. The service department maintained a core crew but also reduced hours.

• Return to Work: As the state allowed businesses to reopen in May 2020, Martin Motors gradually rehired and restored hours, although full pre‑COVID staffing was not re‐achieved immediately.

4. Supply Chain Disruptions

• Vehicle Inventory Shortages: The dealership relies on a steady supply of new vehicles from Audi and Volkswagen. COVID‑19 caused many auto factories to temporarily shut down. For example, Audi suspended production at its Mexico plant from March 23 to April 13, 2020 (see: https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/corona-pandemic-audi-ag-takes-stock-after-difficult-first-quarter-12775/download#:~:text=quarter%20www.audi,The%20Four). This shutdown meant that new vehicle shipments plummeted and the dealership’s lot reached its lowest inventory by June 2020.

• Parts and Supply Shortages: Beyond whole vehicles, there were shortages of automotive parts (including the critical semiconductor chip shortage which grew worse through 2021). As chip shortages severely “hobbling vehicle production” became widespread (with estimates showing over 7 million vehicles lost globally), Martin Motors could not obtain enough new vehicles even if demand was strong.

• Duration: Supply chain disruptions began in Q2 2020 and continued, with the chip crisis persisting well into Q2/Q3 2021. Even if the showroom reopened, the inability to obtain inventory meant that operations were “partially suspended” in effect.

• Notably, Martin Motors is not basing its ERC eligibility on a decline in gross receipts—its eligibility is claimed solely on the government order (suspension) test.

Government Orders Affecting Operations (Q2 2020 – Q3 2021)

Multiple government orders at the federal, state, county, and city levels imposed restrictions that impacted the dealership’s operations from April 2020 through September 2021. The following is a listing of the major orders and directives, along with their details and impact on Martin Motors:

──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Federal Level

1. U.S. National Emergency Declaration (Proclamation 9994)
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (retroactive to March 1, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: Remained active (the emergency declaration continued through much of the ERC period)
   • Summary: President Donald Trump declared that the COVID‑19 outbreak constituted a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act. This empowered federal agencies such as FEMA and HHS to redirect resources and waive certain regulations. Although this declaration did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for later governmental actions affecting commerce.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: The national emergency signaled the severity of the pandemic. It enabled subsequent orders at both the federal and state levels that disrupted normal business operations and played a role in interrupting vehicle supply chains.

2. Presidential Defense Production Act Order – GM Ventilator Production
   • Date Enacted: March 27, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: Fulfilled by mid‑2020
   • Summary: Under the Defense Production Act, President Trump compelled General Motors (GM) to manufacture ventilators for COVID‑19 patients. This order redirected manufacturing capacity from automobile production to medical equipment.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: This redirection meant that GM and similar auto manufacturers halted or reduced vehicle production. As a result, Martin Motors experienced further supply chain delays and a reduction in new vehicle inventory.

# State Level (West Virginia)

1. West Virginia “Stay‑at‑Home” Order (Executive Order 9‑20)
   • Date Enacted: March 24, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: May 4, 2020 (replaced by the Safer‑at‑Home Order)
   • Summary: Governor Jim Justice ordered all residents of West Virginia to stay at home—except for essential activities—and required non‑essential businesses to close their on‑site operations.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: The dealership was forced to close its showroom (sales operations) during this period. Although its service operations (auto repair) were classified as essential and allowed to continue with modifications, the shutdown of the core sales area drastically reduced business.

2. West Virginia Hotspot Restrictions for Harrison County (Executive Order 21‑20)
   • Date Enacted: April 4, 2020 (approximately; some sources note April 5)
   • Date Rescinded: May 19, 2020 (hotspot status removed by Executive Order 38‑20)
   • Summary: Due to rising COVID‑19 cases, Harrison County (and other counties) were designated as “hotspots.” This order imposed stricter limits on gatherings and travel within the county, enforcing tighter restrictions than those statewide.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: Being located in Harrison County, the dealership faced even stricter enforcement of shutdown measures. This meant that no in‑person sales were allowed and, in some cases, even essential operations were enforced with minimal personnel.

3. West Virginia “Safer‑at‑Home” Order (Executive Order 32‑20)
   • Date Enacted: May 4, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: Gradually replaced by reopening measures; restrictions remained in effect in modified form until mid‑2021.
   • Summary: This order ended the blanket stay‑at‑home mandate and allowed businesses to reopen in phases under a “Safer‑at‑Home” policy. Reopening was permitted provided businesses followed social distancing, capacity limits, and hygiene protocols.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: The Safer‑at‑Home order enabled Martin Motors to reopen its showroom on a limited, appointment‑based basis. However, operations remained restricted (capacity limits, required health precautions), so while business resumed, it was under curtailed conditions.

4. West Virginia Statewide Face Covering Mandate (Executive Order 50‑20)
   • Date Enacted: July 7, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: November 14, 2020 (then superseded by an expanded mandate via EO 77‑20)
   • Summary: In response to rising cases, Governor Justice mandated that all individuals age 9 and older wear face coverings in indoor public spaces.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: The dealership had to enforce mask-wearing for employees and customers. This meant that any in‑person interactions were subject to strict safety protocols, indirectly lowering business capacity and affecting the customer experience.
   • Link: https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-employee-retention-credit (see related IRS guidance for mask orders) and additional details may be found on West Virginia state COVID‑19 pages.

5. West Virginia Expanded Mask Order (Executive Order 77‑20)
   • Date Enacted: November 14, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: June 20, 2021
   • Summary: This order tightened the existing mask mandate by requiring masks at all times indoors without the previous exception based on distancing. It also required public posting of “Masks Required” signage and allowed for enforcement actions.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: Martin Motors had to step up its enforcement of mask wearing in all indoor areas. Sales consultations, test drives, and other interactions were conducted under the strict rule, adding operational challenges and reducing customer throughput.

6. West Virginia Full Reopening Order (Executive Order 8‑21)
   • Date Enacted: March 6, 2021
   • Date Rescinded: This order lifted certain restrictions rather than imposing new ones.
   • Summary: With declining case numbers and vaccine rollout, this order removed many occupancy limits—raising capacity for restaurants, bars, and retail establishments to full capacity, subject to remaining health guidelines.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: The removal of capacity restrictions allowed the dealership’s showroom to operate at full physical capacity. Sales events could resume with larger numbers of customers, allowing the business to return toward normal operations (though mask rules remained until June 2021).

# County Level (Harrison County)

1. Harrison County COVID‑19 Emergency Proclamation
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: Not specifically rescinded (remained effective during the active period of the emergency)
   • Summary: The Harrison County Commission declared a local state of emergency to activate enhanced public health measures, including closing county facilities such as the courthouse and suspending in‑person county meetings.
   • Impact on Martin Motors: Although the proclamation did not impose direct additional restrictions on private businesses beyond state orders, it reinforced the state’s mandates. It also disrupted Martin Motors’ interactions with county offices (e.g., delays in title processing or licensing) and signaled vigorous local enforcement of social distancing rules.

# City Level (Clarksburg, WV)

1. City of Clarksburg Emergency Ordinance and Facility Closures
   • Date Enacted: Approximately March 16–17, 2020 (when Clarksburg declared a local emergency)
   • Date Rescinded: Lasted through the active phase of the local emergency
   • Summary: In response to COVID‑19, the City of Clarksburg declared its emergency, leading to the closure of municipal buildings (such as City Hall) and the suspension of large public events. The city adopted and enforced state mandates (masking and social distancing).
   • Impact on Martin Motors: Although Clarksburg did not impose separate shielding orders on auto dealers, the city’s emergency status meant that local services (such as permitting and inspections) experienced delays. In addition, local law enforcement was tasked with ensuring that the state’s COVID‑19 restrictions were followed in business premises.

Form 886-A – ERC Eligibility Analysis (Q2 2020 to Q3 2021)

Taxpayer: Martin Motors of West Virginia (Clarksburg, WV)
Tax Periods: Q2 2020, Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021, Q3 2021 (Employee Retention Credit quarters at issue)

Issue:
Was Martin Motors of West Virginia fully or partially suspended by government orders during Q2 2020 through Q3 2021? Specifically, did federal, state, and local government orders related to COVID‑19 limit or halt its business operations in such a way as to meet the “full or partial suspension” test under Section 2301(c)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of the CARES Act?

The analysis breaks this down into several sub-questions:
• Were qualifying government orders in effect during these quarters that applied to Martin Motors (directly or indirectly)?
• Did these orders result in a full or partial suspension (i.e., “more than a nominal portion” of operations) of the dealership’s business?
• Did disruptions to suppliers (due to government orders) further contribute to an inability to operate normally?
• Do these timeframes align with the quarters for which ERC is claimed?

Facts:
• Q2 2020: The WV Stay-at-Home Order (EO 9‑20) forced the closure of the dealership’s showroom in April 2020. Service operations continued only on a limited basis.
• Q3 & Q4 2020: Though the dealership reopened with safety protocols (mask mandate, social distancing) under the Safer‑at‑Home policy and expanded mask orders, these measures significantly reduced in‑person sales capacity.
• Q1 2021: Although some restrictions were easing, severe supply chain disruptions—stemming from government‑ordered plant shutdowns—caused critical shortages in vehicle inventory.
• Q2 2021: The mask mandate remained in effect until June 20, 2021 and continued supply chain shortages meant operations were still curtailed.
• Q3 2021: Even though local restrictions were lifted, ongoing supply problems (directly traceable to earlier government orders on auto manufacturers and parts suppliers) meant that the dealership’s sales operations continued to operate at only a fraction of normal capacity.

Legal Framework:
• Under the CARES Act §2301(c)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and IRS Notice 2021‑20, a business qualifies for ERC if its operations are fully or partially suspended by government orders that limit commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID‑19.
• “Partial suspension” is defined as an interruption in operations where more than a nominal portion (generally, at least 10% of the business activity) is suspended.
• The IRS also permits a suspension qualification when an employer’s suppliers are unable to deliver critical goods due to government‑ordered shutdowns, thereby indirectly suspending the employer’s business operations.

Argument:
1. Q2 2020: The statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order and Harrison County hotspot restrictions led to a full shutdown of the sales operations (showroom) in April 2020. Because the sales department typically represents a significant portion of revenue (well over 10%), this satisfies the partial suspension criteria for the quarter.
2. Q3 and Q4 2020: Reopening under stringent mask and social distancing orders—at a capacity limited significantly from normal—constituted a partial suspension of normal business operations.
3. Q1–Q3 2021: Ongoing government‑ordered supply chain disruptions (stemming from state orders in auto manufacturing and international shutdowns) directly led to inventory shortages. Even if the physical premises were open, the inability to obtain vehicles (a critical input) meant that the dealership was essentially operating at a reduced (partial suspension) level.
4. Even if some quarters did not show a significant decline in gross receipts (due to alternative pricing or limited sales), the government order test is independently satisfied based on the imposed restrictions and supply chain interruptions.

Conclusion:
Martin Motors of West Virginia meets the ERC eligibility criteria for each quarter from Q2 2020 through Q3 2021 because government orders—both directly (through stay‑at‑home, masking, and capacity restrictions) and indirectly (through supplier shutdowns)—forced the business to suspend or partially suspend its core operations. Documentation of these orders (the Governor’s executive orders, county hotspot declarations, and evidence from auto manufacturers regarding plant shutdowns) substantiates that, “but for” these orders, the dealership would have continued normal business operations. Therefore, Martin Motors is fully entitled to claim the Employee Retention Credit for qualified wages paid during the affected quarters.
