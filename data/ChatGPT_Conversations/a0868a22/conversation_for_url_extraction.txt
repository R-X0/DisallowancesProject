COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

-----------------------------------------------------------
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020【43†L106-L115】
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021【43†L106-L115】)
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)
  
  Summary:
  This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak【43†L106-L115】. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)
  
  Summary:
  Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols rather than blanket closures, but the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Federal Note:
The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID-19 State of Emergency”
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020【45†L72-L80】
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)
  
  Summary:
  Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19【45†L72-L80】. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (e.g. suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (like fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – “Statewide ‘Stay-at-Home’ Order”
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020【47†L31-L39] (effective immediately)
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021【58†L1-L4】
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021【58†L1-L4】. Also superseded by later phased reopening orders.
  
  Summary:
  This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to stay home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors【47†L31-L39】. It forced “non-essential” businesses (like dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or shift to minimum basic operations, while “essential” businesses (food stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) could remain open with precautions. In Q3 2020, the direct effects of this March order had evolved – by that summer, California was gradually reopening some sectors – but many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints that stemmed from this original shutdown. For example, retail shops and restaurants in Q3 2020 were only allowed limited operations (outdoor or reduced capacity) because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay-home mandate. The order’s continuation (it was in force “until further notice”【47†L33-L41】) reflected the sustained risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and case trends improved by mid-2021【20†L63-L70】. The presence of this order (and its modifying successors) in Q3 2020 meant businesses were still far from normal – it explains why, that quarter, many Camarillo businesses were either closed or severely limited in service.
  
• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)”
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20)【18†L39-L47】
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021【22†L407-L414】 (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order)
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), §5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order【22†L407-L414】.
  
  Summary:
  As COVID case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began “Stage 2” of reopening. Consistent with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the March stay-home restrictions【18†L39-L47】. It allowed lower-risk businesses to reopen with modifications: for example, retail stores (clothing, bookstores, florists, etc.) could offer curbside pickup, and manufacturing supply chains for those retailers could resume【29†L459-L467】. However, higher-risk establishments (dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons, etc.) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order was part of the gradual reopening that led into summer – by July, many local retailers were operating (at least in curbside or limited-capacity modes) thanks to the Stage 2 easing. The rationale was to revive economic activity while still controlling spread. However, because COVID surged in summer 2020, these initial reopenings were soon paused or reversed (see July order below), which significantly affected businesses in Q3 2020 – many had to scale back operations again just weeks after reopening, underscoring the tenuous situation that quarter.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020【18†L49-L57】
  Date Rescinded: Superseded August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021【22†L407-L414】
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system; and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions【22†L407-L414】.
  
  Summary:
  In July 2020, California experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. In response, the State Health Officer re-imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. Statewide, this July 13 order closed many indoor operations that had been allowed in Stage 2: for example, restaurants had to shut indoor dining (outdoor and take-out were allowed), bars, breweries and movie theaters were closed, and museums/zoos were closed again indoors【18†L49-L57】. Additionally, counties on the state’s monitoring list (areas with the worst outbreaks, which included Ventura County) had to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non-critical offices, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and malls【18†L49-L57】. This had a major impact in Q3 2020: Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June had to partially or fully close again in July. For example, restaurants in Camarillo during Q3 2020 could only offer outdoor dining or takeout, and gyms and salons were forced shut for the remainder of the summer. These renewed restrictions in the middle of Q3 dramatically cut business revenues and operations. The reason for this rollback was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID-19” in California【18†L49-L57】 – essentially, the summer surge forced the state to hit the “emergency brake,” directly affecting businesses in that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color-Tier Reopening System”
  Order Number: State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)【51†L68-L76】
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021【22†L407-L414】
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective 6/15/2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system【22†L407-L414】.
  
  Summary:
  California unveiled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on Aug. 28, 2020 as a long-term, color-coded tier system for COVID-19 restrictions【51†L68-L76】. This new framework replaced the blunt monitoring-list closures with a graduated, risk-based approach. Every county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial, Orange = moderate, Yellow = minimal) based on local case rates and test positivity. Each tier set specific rules for businesses: for example, in Purple tier (the most restrictive), many non-essential indoor business operations were prohibited, whereas in Red or Orange tiers, certain indoor operations could open with capacity limits【51†L65-L72】【51†L88-L96】. Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on Aug 31, 2020, since case rates were high【9†L13-L21】【9†L15-L23】. In Q3 2020, this meant that although the blanket July closures were lifted, most Camarillo businesses still faced heavy restrictions: retail stores could open indoors with limited capacity, but indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed in the Purple tier (only outdoor or take-home services allowed). As conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier by October, easing some rules. The Blueprint’s purpose was to provide a predictable structure: it gradually reopened businesses in Q3/Q4 2020 when COVID metrics improved, but also allowed tightening if metrics worsened【51†L65-L72】. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, the Blueprint meant their operating status was tied to Ventura County’s tier – and during that quarter the county was mostly in the most restrictive tier, explaining why many businesses were still severely limited. The tier system remained in effect until statewide vaccinations and declining cases enabled California to “retire” the Blueprint on June 15, 2021【20†L63-L70】, at which point nearly all business restrictions were lifted.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in SoCal region Dec 6, 2020)【59†L55-L63】【59†L75-L83】
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021【54†L355-L363】
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order statewide (Jan. 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved【54†L355-L363】.
  
  Summary:
  In late 2020, facing a dire winter surge, California introduced the Regional Stay-at-Home Order – a stricter lockdown tied to ICU capacity. Ventura County is part of the Southern California region, which fell below the 15% ICU availability threshold on Dec. 4, 2020【59†L55-L63】, triggering this order. The Regional Order essentially pulled counties back to full shutdown if their region’s hospitals were in crisis. It required the closure of many business sectors, both indoor and outdoor: for example, restaurants had to stop outdoor dining (take-out only), personal care services (hair and nail salons) closed entirely, movie theaters, museums, amusement centers closed, and retail stores had to further reduce capacity (down to 20%)【59†L81-L90】【59†L101-L109】. This was the most stringent measure since spring. Although this order took effect in Q4 2020, its impact carried into early Q1 2021, and it highlighted the precarious situation businesses faced. (By Q3 2020, businesses might have hoped the worst was over, but the emergence of this order in December showed that restrictions could return if conditions worsened.) Q3 2020 itself was not directly under the Regional Stay-at-Home Order, but the looming threat of a resurgent virus (which materialized in winter) meant businesses remained cautious. The Regional Order was lifted on Jan. 25, 2021 when ICU forecasts improved, putting Ventura County back into the Purple tier system【54†L355-L363】. The existence of this emergency brake mechanism is a reminder of why Q3 2020 business conditions were tenuous – the pandemic’s trajectory was uncertain, and even a quarter later businesses would face another round of closures due to factors (ICU strain) that were already a concern in mid-2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – “Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers”
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021)【20†L63-L70】【22†L407-L414】
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order ended prior orders; it did not get “rescinded” – it replaced them)
  Rescinded By: The order itself rescinded the remaining COVID business restrictions. (California’s underlying state of emergency continued, but without the business closures/tier framework.)
  
  Summary:
  This pair of orders (Governor’s EO and a State Health Officer Order) marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. They formally terminated the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order (EO N-33-20) and “retired” the Blueprint tier system statewide【20†L63-L70】【58†L1-L4】. Practically, it lifted capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other COVID-related operating restrictions on businesses. After this date, Camarillo businesses could generally operate at pre-pandemic levels (subject only to any remaining mask rules or industry-specific guidance). In the context of Q3 2020, this June 2021 milestone highlights how far into the future the restrictions persisted. The fact that California did not fully lift business constraints until mid-2021 underscores why Q3 2020 was heavily impacted – businesses spent that quarter under evolving but continued rules, awaiting a normalcy that came roughly three quarters later. The reason this “Beyond the Blueprint” order could be issued was improving public health metrics (dropping cases and widespread vaccinations by spring 2021), which were absent in Q3 2020 – thus, businesses in mid-2020 had to contend with the stricter earlier orders until conditions allowed this final reopening.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020【38†L19-L27】
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–21 (county emergency remained in effect; ultimately ended in 2022, beyond our scope)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, beyond our timeframe)
  
  Summary:
  Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020 in response to COVID-19【38†L19-L27】, quickly ratified by county authorities. The declaration itself didn’t impose restrictions on businesses, but it provided the legal basis for the County Health Officer to issue health orders and for the county to coordinate emergency resources. By establishing that a local health emergency existed, it allowed Ventura County to mirror and enforce state orders (like shelter-in-place) and to act swiftly in targeting local outbreak conditions. In Q3 2020, this emergency status was still active, meaning Ventura County had the ongoing authority to issue local rules affecting Camarillo businesses. The local emergency’s continuation into late 2020 was due to the sustained threat of COVID-19 – it justified why the county could keep certain local rules (like mask recommendations or enforcement of state directives) in place, thereby impacting businesses throughout the quarter.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  Order Date: March 17, 2020【61†L78-L83】
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020【61†L95-L102】 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this order【61†L95-L102】
  
  Summary:
  Before the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its early restrictions on March 17, 2020. The March 17 health officer order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain businesses and public facilities until at least April 2, 2020【61†L78-L83】. In practice, this meant that even before Newsom’s statewide mandate, Ventura County had shut down venues like bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters, and limited restaurants to take-out only. Although this local order was quickly eclipsed by the more comprehensive March 19 state order (and incorporated into a local “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20), it set the tone for aggressive local action. Its early issuance shows the county’s proactive approach—a stance that continued through the rest of 2020. The reason for this early order was the immediate concern over COVID-19 spread in mid-March—a concern that persisted into Q3, influencing later decisions.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay-Home Order”
  Order Date: March 20, 2020【61†L95-L102】
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally ended by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions【7†L29-L35】)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order June 15, 2021, which noted the end of the Governor’s stay-home order and lifted remaining local restrictions【7†L29-L35】
  
  Summary:
  The Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” order, issued on March 20, 2020, was the local companion to California’s statewide stay-home mandate. It required all Ventura County residents to remain in their homes except for essential needs or work for essential businesses【61†L95-L102】. This order locally enforced what the state required and defined for Ventura County which businesses were considered “essential.” Under this mandate, virtually all Camarillo businesses had to cease in-person operations unless they qualified as essential (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, or healthcare providers). Although the strict order was amended over time to allow partial reopenings, its core restrictions influenced Q3 2020 operations—for example, capacity limits and partial closures were based on this order’s framework. Its prolonged effect into Q3 was driven by continued high COVID-19 case counts; the county could not fully lift the order until the public health situation improved. This explains why many Camarillo businesses experienced significant restrictions throughout Q3 2020.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
  Order Dates:
    - March 31, 2020: Extended stay-home to April 19, 2020【6†L73-L77】
    - April 9, 2020: Added gathering ban and safety protocols【13†L49-L57】【13†L39-L47】
    - April 20, 2020: Further extended stay-home through May 15, 2020【61†L95-L102】【61†L78-L83】
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond); fully repealed by May 7, 2020 county order that replaced the April orders with state-aligned regulations【61†L99-L107】
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020 (“Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap)
  
  Summary:
  Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its orders. On March 31, 2020, the Health Officer extended the “Stay Well at Home” order. Then on April 9, 2020, amid the first surge, an updated order banned all gatherings except within a single household and mandated social distancing protocols for essential businesses. An April 20 order further extended the stay-home timeline into mid-May. Although these orders were replaced by a new reopening order on May 7, 2020, they laid the groundwork for practices (masking, distancing, limiting gatherings) that influenced how businesses operated when they eventually reopened. For Q3 2020, even though the formal orders were no longer active, their safety protocols and impact on business throughput remained critical.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
  Order Dates:
    - May 7, 2020: Issued “Safely Reopening” order that replaced prior orders with state-aligned regulations【6†L64-L72】
    - May 20, 2020: Amendment allowing dine-in restaurants and in-store retail with precautions【29†L437-L445】
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state Blueprint (Aug 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 state order ending all local restrictions【22†L407-L414】
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on Aug. 31, 2020 (aligning with the state Blueprint) and ultimately by the June 15, 2021 reopening.
  
  Summary:
  In early May 2020, as initial reopening began statewide, Ventura County’s “Safely Reopening” order allowed certain businesses to resume operations with safety measures in place. The May 7 order replaced the stricter previous orders, permitting lower-risk industries (such as curbside pickup retail and manufacturing) to resume. Then, an amendment on May 20 allowed dine-in restaurants and retail stores to operate indoors under strict guidelines. For Q3 2020, these orders were significant because they set the stage for the summer period when many Camarillo businesses reopened—albeit at reduced capacity and under strict health protocols. However, the subsequent surge in cases later in the summer led to renewed restrictions, so the Q3 experience was a mixed picture of cautious reopening followed by renewed shutdowns in July.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020)【39†L5-L12】
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (the order was limited to the Independence Day weekend)
  Rescinded By: The order expired at its set time after July 5, 2020.
  
  Summary:
  Anticipating crowding over the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID-19 cases, Ventura County ordered beaches closed and parking lots off-limits for that weekend (July 3–5, 2020)【39†L5-L12】. This preemptive measure aimed to prevent large gatherings and potential “super-spreader” events. For Camarillo businesses, particularly those that depended on tourism or coastal commerce in the nearby region, this meant a temporary loss of revenue during what is normally a busy period.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)【9†L31-L39】
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved to Tier 2)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020, which allowed certain indoor operations to reopen with limits【9†L31-L39】
  
  Summary:
  In response to Governor Newsom’s July 13 statewide closures, Ventura County issued a local order to enforce those restrictions. This order re-closed indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, churches, and personal care services that had reopened earlier. For Q3 2020, this meant that many businesses in Camarillo—such as fitness centers, nail salons, and other personal service providers—faced a second closure or severe restrictions starting in mid-July. The order remained in effect until improved conditions in October allowed some sectors to reopen under a less restrictive tier system. Its issuance was driven by the summer surge, directly impacting Q3 business operations.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  Order Date: October 6, 2020【9†L13-L21】【9†L31-L39】
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (superseded by December 2020 Regional Stay Home and later return to Purple tier in Jan 2021)
  Rescinded By: Effectively superseded by the Dec. 2020 Regional Stay Home Order and later by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening.
  
  Summary:
  Early October 2020 saw an improvement in Ventura County’s COVID situation, leading to a move from the Purple to the Red tier. The Health Officer’s October 6 order allowed specific businesses (gyms, houses of worship, personal care services such as nail salons) to reopen indoors under strict guidelines. Although this new order came just after Q3 ended, it was directly tied to the Q3 experience: many businesses had been closed or restricted throughout July–September, and this order represented the first easing after a painful summer surge. It illustrates that while Q3 was characterized by continued closures, there was an emerging signal of recovery as conditions improved.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020【6†L66-L72】 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020【66†L144-L150】)
  Date Rescinded: September 30, 2020 for commercial evictions; for residential, state law (via AB 3088) took effect Sept 1, 2020
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; Ventura County’s commercial moratorium ended as per local extension schedules.
  
  Summary:
  In recognition of the financial hardship caused by the pandemic, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors enacted an urgency ordinance (No. 4563) to temporarily bar evictions for tenants unable to pay rent because of COVID-19 losses【31†L33-L40】. This applied not only to residential properties but also provided some protection for small-business commercial tenants in unincorporated Ventura County. In Q3 2020, while state law took over protections for residential tenants, the county’s moratorium on commercial evictions remained in effect until September 30, 2020. This measure was critical for local businesses that were struggling financially—they could delay rent payments and avoid losing their physical premises during the most restrictive phase of the pandemic, though it did not forgive the debt.

-----------------------------------------------------------
City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020【38†L29-L37】 (ratified by City Council Resolution No. 20-36 on March 13, 2020)
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained into 2021; eventually lifted in 2022, outside the current scope)
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022)
  
  Summary:
  On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19 via EOC Order No. 20-1, ratified by the City Council【38†L29-L37】. This declaration activated the city's Emergency Operations Center and enabled the rapid deployment of resources and emergency measures. Under the emergency, the city closed facilities (such as City Hall, public library, community center, etc.) and canceled public events. For local businesses, this meant that city services or events (like permits, city-hosted markets, or fairs) were suspended. The maintained state of emergency through 2020 affirmed the seriousness of the situation and bolstered additional local measures that affected business operations.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and Amendment (April 23, 2020)【35†L218-L222】
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial), amended April 23, 2020
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (for residential, effective Sept 2020) and eventually expired with the end of the local emergency for any remaining commercial provisions.
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (Tenant Relief Act) on Aug. 31, 2020 for residential; and later by the termination of the city’s emergency.
  
  Summary:
  To protect tenants during the early financial strain of the pandemic, Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium on March 18, 2020 (EOC Order No. 20-2) and later amended it on April 23, 2020【35†L218-L222】. This order temporarily halted evictions of both residential and commercial tenants facing COVID-related income loss. For local businesses, this measure provided crucial protection from losing their commercial leases during a period of drastically reduced income. Although it did not cancel rent obligations, it allowed businesses to defer payments until conditions improved.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)
  Date Rescinded: Effectively expired when COVID-19 capacity restrictions ended (around June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated.
  
  Summary:
  To help restaurants continue operating while indoor service was restricted, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020-63 in June 2020. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow temporary outdoor dining setups in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. With indoor dining often shuttered by state or county orders, this program enabled restaurants to serve customers outdoors with compliance to safety protocols. For Q3 2020, this action represents a key adaptive measure that mitigated revenue losses by permitting a modified dine-in (outdoor) service model.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
  Dates: Various dates throughout 2020 (spring–summer)
  
  Summary:
  In addition to the major orders listed, the City of Camarillo implemented several other supportive steps. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online to minimize in-person contact, and promoting take-out dining campaigns to bolster local restaurants. Code enforcement efforts were also coordinated with Ventura County to ensure compliance with COVID health orders. Together, these actions contributed to the overall regulatory environment that affected businesses during Q3 2020.

Overall Context and Impact for Q3 2020

All levels of government—from federal to state to county to city—played a role in shaping the COVID-19 regulatory landscape that directly impacted businesses in Camarillo during 2020–2021. In Q3 2020, while some sectors had reopened under cautious conditions (often with reduced capacity and strict protocols), renewed outbreaks (especially the summer surge) forced additional closures and restrictions. National emergency proclamations enabled state and local authorities to impose lockdowns, while progressively evolving reopening orders (such as Stage 2 reopening, the July rollback, and the Blueprint tier system) created a volatile environment for business operations. Additionally, eviction moratoriums and supportive local measures (like the outdoor dining program) provided necessary relief to struggling businesses. The cumulative result was that Q3 2020 was a challenging period for Camarillo businesses—characterized by intermittent openings, strict capacity limits, and a constant risk of further shutdowns due to shifting public health data.
