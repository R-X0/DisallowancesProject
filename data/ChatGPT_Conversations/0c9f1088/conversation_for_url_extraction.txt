Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on February 24, 2021)  
   • Rescinded By: Later terminated by Congress in 2023 (outside the 2020–2021 scope)
   
   Summary:
   This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, thereby enabling states and localities to impose lockdowns and other public health measures. Although it did not directly mandate business closures, the national emergency provided the legal and funding framework for subsequent state and local restrictions. As a result, businesses in Camarillo in Q3 2020 operated under an ongoing national emergency that both allowed for federal stimulus support and underscored the seriousness of the pandemic.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC Order effective February 1, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate

   Summary:
   Under the new administration in early 2021, federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel were established via an executive order and a subsequent CDC directive. These orders required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. Although these mandates primarily affected travel and transportation sectors rather than directly impacting local businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020, they highlight the continued federal response to COVID-19 as the country transitioned into 2021. The mandates underscored the ongoing precautions that would later extend into various sectors as reopening efforts evolved.

California State Orders

1. State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID-19 State of Emergency”
   • Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout the period)
   • Rescinded By: Ended on February 28, 2023 by a subsequent proclamation (beyond the 2020–2021 period)

   Summary:
   Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 in response to COVID-19. This declaration empowered state authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting critical sectors including business operations, mobilize emergency resources, and temporarily suspend certain regulations. For businesses, especially in Q3 2020, the ongoing state of emergency justified the imposition of restrictive measures while also opening avenues for financial relief and regulatory accommodations. It set the legal stage for the subsequent, more detailed executive orders that defined daily operations during the pandemic.

2. Executive Order N-33-20 – “Statewide ‘Stay-at-Home’ Order”
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home Order; later replaced by a phased reopening order
   
   Summary:
   This sweeping statewide order required all Californians to remain at home except for essential activities. It forced non-essential businesses, including many that support a typical “business” operation (such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, and theaters), to either close or operate at severely reduced capacity. By Q3 2020 the direct mandate had evolved into a series of modifications that allowed limited reopenings but with continuing restrictions largely stemming from this original shutdown. Its continued impact meant that many Camarillo businesses operated with limited indoor capacities and strict safety protocols during the third quarter.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)”
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under EO N-60-20)
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)

   Summary:
   As California approached a plateau in new cases during the spring, this order initiated Stage 2 of reopening. It allowed lower-risk businesses such as curbside retail and certain manufacturing operations to resume work under strict safety protocols, while higher-risk sectors (e.g. dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this order was important because it represented both the hope of reopening and the fluctuating nature of these permissions—as reopening in May/June was later rolled back in July due to a surge. Thus, Q3 2020 saw businesses operating under an atmosphere of cautious reopening with strict limitations and then facing renewed restrictions during the summer surge.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded August 31, 2020 by the new Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later the “Beyond Blueprint” Order

   Summary:
   In response to a marked increase in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, the state re-imposed closures on indoor operations. Sectors that had reopened under Stage 2—such as indoor dining, gyms, and personal care services—were again forced to close indoors, although limited outdoor operations (take-out, outdoor dining) might have been permitted. This sudden rollback significantly impacted Camarillo businesses that had started to reopen in early summer, leading to sharp revenue declines as companies were forced to switch back to a more severe operational model. The rationale was the need to quickly curb the surge in cases causing widespread concern.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color-Tier Reopening System”
   • Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (issued August 28, 2020); effective August 31, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)

   Summary:
   On August 28, 2020, California transitioned from the previous reopening phase to a risk-based “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” tier system that dictated the operating rules for all businesses. Counties were assigned a color-coded tier (Purple, Red, Orange, or Yellow) based on local case metrics. Ventura County, including Camarillo, was placed initially in the Purple tier, meaning that many indoor operations were heavily restricted. For Q3 2020 businesses, this framework meant that even though some restrictions were easing compared to July, many sectors were still forced to operate at a reduced capacity or limit service to outdoor or take-out options until local metrics improved later in the year.

6. Regional Stay-at-Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
   • Order Date: Announced December 3, 2020 (triggered December 6, 2020 in the Southern California region)
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021
   • Rescinded By: Announced lifting by state public health officials on January 25, 2021

   Summary:
   Amid the severe winter surge, California implemented a Regional Stay-at-Home Order that automatically mandated stricter shutdown measures if ICU bed availability dropped below 15%. Although this order was in effect in December 2020 and into early January 2021, its looming presence throughout 2020 put businesses on alert. While Q3 2020 itself was not under this December order, the expectation that similar emergency measures could recur influenced business decisions and customer behavior in the third quarter.

   (Link: Refer to regional stay-at-home details on city and county health websites; one reference from Montclair: https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/)

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tier Framework
   • Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Public Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021; effective June 15, 2021)
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021
   • Date Rescinded: This order did not “rescind” earlier orders by itself; rather, it ended the restrictive framework
   • Rescinded (or effectively ended) prior COVID business restrictions instated since March 2020

   Summary:
   This set of orders marked the full reopening of California by lifting the statewide Stay-at-Home and Blueprint tier system restrictions. They allowed businesses, including those in Camarillo, to resume operations at pre-pandemic levels (aside from a few remaining measures such as masks). The Q3 2020 environment contrasted sharply with these orders because during Q3 businesses were still grappling with multiple layers of restrictions and operational limitations. The issuance of “Beyond the Blueprint” in June 2021 underscores that the restrictive measures were still very much in place through much of 2020 and into early 2021, which had long-lasting impacts on business operations and planning.

Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended in 2022)
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution in 2022

   Summary:
   On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency in response to COVID-19. Although this declaration by itself did not impose business restrictions, it provided the legal foundation for all subsequent county orders and measures that directly affected businesses. For Q3 2020, the enduring local health emergency meant that the county retained the authority to enforce protective measures and issue updated orders as needed. This helped ensure that any reopening or operational guidelines for Camarillo businesses were backed by local law.

   (Link: See Ventura County announcements on local health emergencies, e.g., local county websites.)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order and then formally repealed by later orders
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County order of March 20, 2020

   Summary:
   Before the statewide order came into full force, Ventura County issued an early order forbidding large gatherings and ordering the closure of bars, gyms, movie theaters, and similar venues. Although quickly replaced by a more comprehensive stay-at-home directive, this early move set the tone for aggressive local action. Its early timing reflected the county’s proactive approach and served as a precursor to further restrictions that would carry into Q3 2020 in modified forms.

   (Link: Ventura County Public Health Order documents; e.g., on the county website.)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay-Home Order”
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in line with state reopening)
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated June 15, 2021

   Summary:
   Issued on March 20, 2020, this local order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities and permitted only essential businesses to operate. Under its framework, all non-essential businesses—including many in Camarillo—had to cease in-person operations. Although by Q3 2020 modifications had allowed some phased reopenings, most businesses were still limited by the lingering effects and derivative restrictions originally set by this order. Its extended duration highlights the stringent local measures that affected business operations well into the summer of 2020.

   (Link: Refer to Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” order – for example, https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf for later updates.)

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
   • Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: These were superseded by the May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order and later state-aligned regulations
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020

   Summary:
   Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County repeatedly updated its stay-at-home directive to extend its time period, impose gathering bans, and mandate social distancing measures for essential businesses. These updates required even essential businesses to implement strict safety protocols such as posting COVID-19 safety plans and enforcing distancing. While these orders themselves were replaced as the county moved towards reopening in May, the safety practices mandated then remained in force into Q3 2020 and continued to influence how every business adapted its operations.

   (Link: See additional documents published by Ventura County Public Health regarding order extensions.)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
   • Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amended)
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by later state Blueprint orders (effective August 31, 2020) and then by the June 15, 2021 state order
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer update on August 31, 2020 and the statewide “Beyond Blueprint” order

   Summary:
   In early May 2020, as the county tentative moved toward reopening, Ventura County issued orders that relaxed previous stay-at-home restrictions. Initially, the May 7 order allowed certain lower-risk sectors (such as curbside retail and logistics) to resume operations. Then, on May 20, with state approval for an accelerated Stage 2 reopening, additional sectors like dine-in restaurants were permitted to open under strict COVID-19 protocols. For Q3 2020 businesses, these orders meant that many local establishments were operating—albeit with limited capacity and under constant adjustments—as the county tried to balance economic reopening with public health.

   (Link: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf)

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
   • Order Date: June 30, 2020 (order announced for July 3–5, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: The order expired on July 6, 2020 (it was in effect only for the Independence Day weekend)
   
   Summary:
   To prevent large gatherings during the Independence Day weekend amid rising case numbers, Ventura County ordered beaches to be closed and parking lots to be off-limits. Although Camarillo is inland, this measure affected regional tourism and related business revenues by curtailing visitor numbers to nearby coastal areas. The decision was a targeted short-term closure aimed at reducing “super-spreader” event risks and illustrates how even holiday periods were subject to sudden, temporary shutdowns during the pandemic.

   (Link: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County)

7. Ventura County Local Order on July 13, 2020 – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved into the Red tier
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated October 6, 2020

   Summary:
   In lockstep with the state’s July 13 order, Ventura County issued its own measure that re-closed indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, personal care services, and places of worship. This ensured that local businesses complied fully with the statewide rollback, even if they had begun to reopen in May or early June. For Camarillo businesses, especially those in the service and hospitality sectors, this locally enforced shutdown resulted in a second, painful round of closures or severe restrictions during the critical Q3 period.
   
   (Link: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf – see also local news sources such as https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/ for related regional details)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Later changes in December 2020 and January 2021; ultimately all county restrictions were ended June 15, 2021
   • Rescinded By: The December 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order and subsequent statewide changes

   Summary:
   When Ventura County’s COVID metrics improved in early October 2020, the county was moved into the Red tier of the state’s Blueprint system. The Health Officer’s October 6 order allowed a gradual relaxation of restrictions, letting certain businesses such as fitness centers, houses of worship, and personal care services resume limited indoor operations. For those businesses in Camarillo, this meant that after enduring months of severe restrictions, there was moderate relief toward the end of Q3 2020. However, the easing was temporary since rising cases later in the year led to renewed restrictions.
   
   (Link: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)
   • Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; passed March 31, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020 (for residential, state law took over effective August 31, 2020)
   • Rescinded By: California AB 3088 for residential tenants and a later county decision for commercial evictions

   Summary:
   Recognizing the financial hardships caused by the pandemic, Ventura County implemented an eviction moratorium to protect both residential and small-business commercial tenants from being evicted for nonpayment of rent. This ordinance allowed businesses to defer rent obligations without the immediate threat of eviction, giving them time to adapt or wait out the shutdown. For Q3 2020, this provided a critical safety net for Camarillo businesses straining under reduced revenue due to continuous COVID-related restrictions. Though not a forgiveness of rent, it prevented immediate closures due to eviction proceedings.

City of Camarillo Orders

1. Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation – “City Declaration of Emergency”
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution No. 20-36)
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (local emergency remained in effect into 2021; lifted in 2022)
   • Rescinded By: A City Council resolution ending the emergency in 2022

   Summary:
   On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID-19, activating its Emergency Operations Center and allowing for a suite of local public health measures. City facilities, such as City Hall, the library, and community centers, were closed to help reduce virus spread. This emergency status also provided a legal basis for later local orders that directly affected business operations in Camarillo, ensuring that the city could quickly implement additional measures as needed. For businesses in Q3 2020, the continued emergency declaration meant that local regulatory flexibility and additional support measures were available if needed.
   
   (Link: Typically available on Camarillo’s official website; for example, see press releases on CamHealth: https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases/)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (initial March 18, 2020) and an Amendment on April 23, 2020
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (for residential tenants, effective September 2020) and ended with the city’s emergency termination (2022)
   • Rescinded By: California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential and later local resolution for any remaining commercial provisions

   Summary:
   To protect local tenants amid financial hardship, Camarillo implemented a moratorium on evictions that applied to both residential and commercial properties likely affected by COVID-19. This order was designed to delay eviction proceedings so that businesses facing severe revenue losses would have a chance to stabilize. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses could rely on this local measure to avoid immediate displacement, even though deferred rent payments would need to be handled later. This served as an important economic lifeline during an uncertain period.
   
   (Link: https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19 and local Camarillo notices)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
   • Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: Effectively expired on June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed (formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)
   • Rescinded By: Automatic sunset as capacity restrictions eased and normal zoning rules returned

   Summary:
   In an effort to help restaurants continue operations amid indoor dining closures, Camarillo’s City Council passed Resolution No. 2020-63, which waived certain zoning requirements and fees to enable temporary outdoor dining setups. This allowed restaurants to quickly install outdoor seating in parking lots, along sidewalks, or other available spaces in compliance with safety guidelines. For Q3 2020, this resolution was vital because it provided a means for many dining establishments to capture at least partial revenue despite indoor restrictions. It represents a proactive local adaptation to balance economic survival with public health imperatives.

4. Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
   • Dates: Various in 2020 (spring through summer)
   
   Summary:
   In addition to the major orders already described, the City of Camarillo implemented a range of supportive measures such as suspending late fees on business taxes, moving permit processes online, and promoting take-out dining campaigns to support local restaurants. These initiatives were designed to lessen the administrative and economic burdens on local businesses during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. Although not “orders” in the strictest sense, these actions formed part of the broader regulatory and economic support framework that affected how businesses operated throughout Q3 2020.

Overall Analysis:
Federal proclamations established the emergency context that allowed subsequent state and local orders. In California, the statewide Stay-at-Home Order (N-33-20) and its subsequent modifications meant that non-essential businesses operated with extreme constraints throughout much of 2020. At the county level, Ventura County’s continuous adjustments—from early closures to phased reopenings and later rollbacks in July 2020—created an environment of uncertainty where businesses struggled to plan and maintain revenue streams. Finally, at the city level, Camarillo’s local emergency declaration, eviction moratorium, and innovative measures like the Temporary Outdoor Dining Program provided both additional restrictions and vital economic relief. By Q3 2020, although some reopening had occurred, many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under significant limitations due to the overlapping layers of federal, state, county, and local orders.
