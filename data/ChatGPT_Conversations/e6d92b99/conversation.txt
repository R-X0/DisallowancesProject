Assistant:
I will compile a list of all COVID‐related government orders, proclamations, and public health directives that were in effect during 2020–2021 and that had an impact on businesses operating in Camarillo, California. This compilation includes federal, California state, Ventura County, and City of Camarillo orders. For each entry, I list the order’s identifying number or name, the enactment and rescission dates (or notes about whether the order was superseded), any subsequent orders that terminated or modified it, and a 3–5 sentence summary of its contents and impact on businesses—especially during the third quarter (Q3) of 2020. In addition, I indicate the underlying rationale for such restrictions.

COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

–––––––
A. Federal Orders
–––––––
1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent congressional action (beyond the scope of 2020–2021)  
   • Summary: This proclamation declared a national emergency, thereby activating federal emergency powers and funding mechanisms to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it provided the legal and fiscal framework that allowed states and localities to impose stricter measures. In Q3 2020, while the proclamation itself was not directly closing businesses, its continued status underscored the severity of the pandemic and supported the state and local directives restricting operations. Federal stimulus programs also derived authority from the emergency declaration, which indirectly affected business stability during the period.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect until later, with a court order in April 2022 lifting the requirement)  
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent court decision in 2022  
   • Summary: Under a new administration, federal mandates were issued that required mask-wearing on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. Although these mask rules did not apply directly to private business operations in Q3 2020 (since they began in 2021), they are part of the overall federal response to the pandemic. They highlight the shifting focus of federal directives from full shutdowns to risk mitigation via personal protective measures as conditions evolved. These measures, while primarily affecting travel and transportation, underscored the continued federal emphasis on public health safety during the pandemic.

–––––––
B. California State Orders
–––––––
1. State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
   • Order/Proclamation: A Governor’s proclamation (no specific order number provided)  
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active; formally ended in February 2023)  
   • Rescinded By: Later termination by the Governor beyond 2021  
   • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 to marshal resources, suspend regulations, and provide emergency relief. This status empowered state agencies to issue wide-ranging orders that severely impacted nonessential business operations. For Q3 2020, the state emergency was still in effect and provided the legal basis for imposing curfews, limitations on capacity, and other health regulations that kept many businesses operating at reduced levels. The emergency declaration also justified the continuation of restrictions designed to protect public health amid rising case counts.

2. Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021) which formally terminated the stay-at-home directive  
   • Summary: This order mandated that all Californians stay at home except for those engaged in “essential” activities. It resulted in the closure of nonessential businesses such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, and entertainment venues, while allowing only essential establishments to operate (often with extra precautions). In Q3 2020, while the strict initial order had been modified to allow partial reopenings, the original framework meant many businesses were still subject to significant capacity restrictions or closure orders. The order’s long duration illustrated the state’s cautious approach during the pandemic and directly contributed to the economic difficulties experienced by local businesses during the third quarter.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home  
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued as part of EO N-60-20)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
   • Rescinded By: A later State Public Health Order “Beyond Blueprint” on June 11, 2021  
   • Summary: As the initial surge began to show signs of plateauing, this order allowed certain lower-risk businesses to reopen with modifications. It permitted curbside pickup and limited operations for retailers and manufacturing support businesses, while leaving high‐risk venues (such as dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons) closed. For businesses in Camarillo, this order meant that by early summer some operations restarted—but always with stringent guidelines and later vulnerability to further lockdowns, as seen with the subsequent July rollback.
   • Link: (Example excerpt available via state health documents; see similar orders on California Department of Public Health site)

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” framework; effectively formally repealed June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: The Transition to the tier system under the Blueprint order  
   • Summary: In response to a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases during the summer surge, this order re-imposed closures on many indoor operations that had been allowed earlier. It forced restaurants to cease indoor dining, closed indoor operations at gyms and personal care services, and mandated similar rollbacks in other high-risk sectors. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, many establishments that had reopened during Stage 2 were forced to quickly re-close indoor facilities, drastically disrupting revenue and stability. The rollback was implemented on account of significantly increased COVID-19 transmission risks evidenced by rising case counts.
   • Link: (A state health document detailing the July 13 order can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/)

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
   • Order Number: The State Public Health Order issued August 28, 2020 (no specific EO number, but often referenced as the Blueprint order)  
   • Date Enacted: Announced August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: “Beyond Blueprint” State Health Officer Order on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: This framework replaced the previous shutdown model with a color-coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local risk levels. Under this plan, counties would have specific rules for business capacity and indoor/outdoor operations. For Ventura County—and therefore Camarillo—most of Q3 2020 fell under the most restrictive tier (often Purple), meaning indoor operations for nonessential sectors were still largely prohibited or severely limited until local health metrics improved. The tier system provided a gradual reopening mechanism but still meant many businesses had to operate at reduced capacity.

6. Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity–Triggered Shutdown  
   • Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; effective December 6, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent statewide announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order once ICU projections improved  
   • Summary: As winter brought a dangerous surge in cases, California’s Regional Stay-at-Home Order was instituted in areas where ICU capacity fell below the critical threshold (15%). Although its full effect was in Q4 2020, it is important for context: by early Q1 2021 the area had seen the most severe shutdowns. For Q3 2020, while not directly under this order, the threat of a renewed shutdown loomed over businesses, and many prepared for the possibility of further restrictions. It highlighted the fragile nature of reopening during the pandemic because of the ever-present possibility of hospital overload.
   • Link: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
   • Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order  
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: This order did not “rescind” itself—it terminated all previous COVID business restrictions.  
   • Rescinded By: This order itself formally ended the stay-at-home and tier-related restrictions.  
   • Summary: Marking the “full reopening” of California, this order ended the statewide restrictions (including the stay-at-home order and the Blueprint tiers) that had been in place since March 2020. Although it came in mid-2021—well after Q3 2020—it underscores how protracted and strict the earlier period was. Q3 2020 remained difficult for businesses because the measures that “Beyond the Blueprint” would later overturn had remained in effect, continuing to limit indoor activity and capacity. This final lifting of restrictions was based on improved public health metrics and widespread vaccinations.

–––––––
C. Ventura County Orders
–––––––
1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained in effect until later, formally ending in 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution in 2022  
   • Summary: The county’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. Although the declaration itself did not impose specific business restrictions, it granted the local health authorities the power to issue the subsequent orders. Throughout 2020—including Q3—this emergency status provided the legal foundation for all later orders (such as stay-at-home and business closure mandates) in Ventura County.
   • Link: (Information available from Ventura County official health sites; see for example local press releases at https://www.portofhueneme.org/ if needed)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial Closures and Gathering Restrictions  
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s Health Officer order issued March 20, 2020  
   • Summary: Before the statewide mandate took full effect, Ventura County issued an order directing certain vulnerable populations to shelter in place and ordering the closure of select businesses and public venues. This early local action set the tone for the county’s approach and was quickly incorporated into a more comprehensive order on March 20. Although the specifics of this March 17 order were later replaced, it reflects the county’s initial swift response—a mindset that persisted into Q3 2020 through ongoing restrictions.
   • Link: (Typically found in Ventura County archives; one reference is https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=On%20March%2017%2C%202020)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)  
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in alignment with state reopening; formally lifted on June 15, 2021)  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities and forced nonessential businesses to suspend in-person operations. For Camarillo businesses (in unincorporated parts of Ventura County or those subject to county oversight), this meant a near-complete shutdown of physical operations except for essential services. In Q3 2020, although modifications had been made to allow some limited reopening, many of the original restrictions (such as reduced capacity and outdoor-only operations) still traced back to the stay-home framework.
   • Link: (A copy is available on Ventura County public health websites; one example is the archived order at https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf)

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)  
   • Order Dates: Extensions issued on March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Replaced by a “Safely Reopening” order on May 7, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020  
   • Summary: In response to the evolving situation, Ventura County extended its stay-home order and added stricter measures such as a ban on gatherings and mandatory social distancing protocols. Although these specific orders were in place during the spring, many of their provisions (masking, distancing, limitation on gatherings) informed the restrictions in Q3 2020 even as the county slowly reopened later that summer. These updates helped set expectations for safety protocols that businesses needed to follow when they resumed operations.
   • Link: (See details in documents such as https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 Reopening  
   • Order Dates: Initially May 7, 2020 with an amendment on May 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint (effective August 31, 2020) and eventually by the June 15, 2021 reopening  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s alignment with the state Blueprint order and later the “Beyond Blueprint” order  
   • Summary: As the spread of COVID-19 showed signs of slowing, Ventura County initiated a cautious reopening plan that allowed certain lower-risk businesses (such as curbside retail, manufacturing support, and later dine-in restaurants with precautions) to resume operations. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that although operations restarted in May 2020, they were still subject to strict safety measures (such as capacity limits, sanitation requirements, and outdoor service mandates) that affected revenue. Many businesses—even if open in Q3 2020—remained vulnerable to a sudden reintroduction of restrictions should the virus surge again.
   • Link: (For example, see details at https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%2020%2C%202020 in related county press releases)

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order  
   • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5 weekend  
   • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired on July 6, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: The order was limited to the Independence Day weekend  
   • Summary: With the anticipation of heavy crowds during the holiday weekend—and in response to rising COVID-19 cases—the county ordered the closure of beaches and restricted access to beach parking areas for the July 4 weekend. While Camarillo is inland, nearby coastal attractions affect local tourism and commerce, so the order indirectly reduced foot traffic and spending in the area. This short-term closure was representative of the targeted measures authorities were willing to take even mid-year to prevent super-spreader events during holidays.

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved to a lower-risk (Red) tier  
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
   • Summary: Following the statewide rollback that forced re-closures on indoor operations, Ventura County issued an order to enforce these restrictions locally. This meant that indoor services for gyms, places of worship, personal care businesses (e.g. salons, tattoo shops) and certain hospitality services in Camarillo had to close or operate only outdoors with restrictions. In Q3 2020, many businesses that had reopened briefly in May/June had to scale back operations significantly when this order went into effect in July. This second wave of closures was a direct reaction to the summer surge in COVID-19 cases.
   • Link: (For details, see Ventura County documents such as those available at https://vcportal.ventura.org/)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order  
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Later changes (with the Regional Stay-at-Home Order in December 2020, and further changes in January 2021)  
   • Rescinded By: Initially superseded by December’s Regional Stay-at-Home Order and, later, by statewide easing in June 2021  
   • Summary: With improvements in local health data, Ventura County moved into the Red tier which allowed some indoor operations to resume under strict capacity limits and safety protocols. This order represented a partial easing from the strict closures of summer, giving hope to businesses that indoor operations (gyms, houses of worship, salons) might soon resume if conditions held. However, for much of Q3 2020 most establishments remained highly restricted or closed indoors, so while this order signaled a turn, its effects were seen more at the very end of Q3 and into early Q4.
   • Link: (See the official order at Ventura County’s site; an example is https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium  
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
   • Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; first passed March 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extant through September 30, 2020; residential protections later replaced by state law as of September 2020 via AB 3088  
   • Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act on August 31, 2020; commercial moratorium eventually expired  
   • Summary: In order to prevent a surge in evictions that might result in homelessness and business failures amidst pandemic-driven revenue loss, Ventura County enacted an eviction moratorium. This order temporarily prohibited landlords in the unincorporated areas (and where applicable, city limits) from evicting tenants—including small, local businesses—facing financial hardship because of the pandemic. For Camarillo business owners caught with reduced revenue in Q3 2020, the moratorium was a crucial protective measure, even though it ultimately offered a deferral rather than cancellation of rent arrears.

–––––––
D. City of Camarillo Orders
–––––––
1. Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)  
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Remained in effect through 2020–2021 (officially ended in 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A Camarillo City Council resolution in April 2022 (outside our timeframe)  
   • Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID-19. This activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed rapid deployment of resources as well as local measures—including closures of city facilities and cancellation of public events. For businesses in Q3 2020, the ongoing emergency declaration not only underscored the need to maintain social distancing and other health protocols but also enabled the city to later issue relief measures tailored to local business needs.
   • Link: (City press releases and emergency orders can be found via Camarillo’s official website; for example, see https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders  
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and its Amendment on April 23, 2020  
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial), amended April 23, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (residential protections via AB 3088 effective September 2020) and ended when the city’s emergency ended  
   • Rescinded By: California AB 3088 for residential tenants; commercial terms eventually phased out  
   • Summary: To protect both residential and small-business commercial tenants facing pandemic-financial hardships, the City of Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium. This order prohibited local landlords from evicting tenants solely on the basis of nonpayment due to COVID-19 economic impact. In Q3 2020, this measure afforded critical relief to many business owners, buying them time despite reduced revenue, although it did not forgive accumulated rent.
   • Link: (Further details can be found in Camarillo’s official documents; for example, see Camarillo press releases available at https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
   • Date Enacted: Early June 2020 (around June 10, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Effectively expired when full indoor dining resumed (around June 15, 2021, and formally tied to the end of the local emergency)  
   • Rescinded By: Sunset as local COVID restrictions were lifted and normal zoning rules resumed  
   • Summary: With indoor dining forced to operate under heavy restrictions or shuttered entirely, the City of Camarillo authorized a temporary outdoor dining program by waiving certain zoning requirements and fees. This emergency measure allowed restaurants to quickly set up patios, sidewalk seating, or open-air areas in parking lots and other available spaces. During Q3 2020, when many restaurants could not operate indoors due to state and county orders, this measure enabled them to continue operating and serving customers, thus mitigating losses.
   • Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020-63

4. Miscellaneous City Measures  
   • Dates: Various throughout spring and summer 2020  
   • Summary: In addition to the above orders, the City of Camarillo took several steps to alleviate business hardships. These included suspending late fees, moving permit processing online, and promoting take-out and delivery services to support local restaurants. Such measures, although not formal “orders” in the same sense as the eviction moratorium or emergency declaration, formed part of the overall regulatory and supportive framework during the pandemic. They directly affected how businesses could adapt to a rapidly changing environment during Q3 2020.

This comprehensive set of orders and summaries illustrates the complex and multi-level governmental response to COVID-19 that affected business operations in Camarillo throughout 2020–2021. In Q3 2020, businesses in the area had to contend with evolving reopening orders, second-wave rollbacks, stringent capacity limits, and a patchwork of eviction and operating measures—not only to comply with public health mandates but also to adapt their operations to survive in a persistent crisis.
