COVID‑19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates (or notes on continuity), any superseding orders or dates, and a 3–5–sentence summary of its provisions and impact on businesses — with a particular emphasis on how Q3 2020 was affected. Possible reasons for the business impact during Q3 2020 are also noted.

─────────────────────────────  
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later continued by Presidential action into February 2021)  
  – Rescinded By: Terminated by Congress in 2023 (outside our scope)
  – Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak, activating federal emergency powers and funding that indirectly empowered subsequent state and local lockdown measures. Although it did not directly mandate business closures, it created the national framework necessary for state and local restrictions. In Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo operated under the continuing implications of this national emergency—both in terms of available federal support (such as stimulus aid) and because it provided legal backing for the stricter measures implemented at lower government levels. Its ongoing existence underscored the severity of the pandemic conditions during Q3 2020.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
  – Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (via Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC Order effective February 1, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded in 2021 (remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  – Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate (beyond our timeframe)
  – Summary: Although the federal mask mandates primarily targeted travel environments such as airplanes, trains, and federal facilities, they were emblematic of the continued federal response. For Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020, these specific travel mandates (which commenced in early 2021) did not have a direct effect; rather, they illustrate how federal action evolved over time—from more direct interventions to guidance and mandates directed toward safety in travel environments. Prior to 2021, local restrictions remained largely driven by state and county orders.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”
  – Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  – Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death))
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  
  – Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by gubernatorial action (beyond our scope)
  – Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 in response to COVID‑19. This declaration empowered the state’s leadership to issue sweeping orders affecting business operations (including suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later ordering lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this state of emergency continued to serve as the legal basis for all further COVID‑related restrictions, ensuring that businesses operated under an extraordinary regulatory regime. The ongoing emergency status helped justify the persistence of stringent restrictions through the summer months.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”
  – Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 ([Link](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as))
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1)%20Executive%20Order%20N-33-20%2C%20issued%20on%20March%2019%2C%202020%2C%20setting%20forth%20the))
  – Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide stay‑at‑home order and was further modified by phased reopening orders.
  – Summary: This executive order mandated that all Californians stay at home except in cases of essential need, thereby forcing “non‑essential” businesses—including restaurants (dine‑in), retail operations, gyms, salons, and theaters—to close or limit operations. By Q3 2020, although some reopening had been attempted (with modifications), many businesses in Camarillo were still heavily constrained due to the lingering effects of this mandate and its subsequent modifications. The strict measures, initially put in place to curb the spread of COVID‑19, continued to affect business operations well into the third quarter, as reopening phases provided only limited relief.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”
  – Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued as part of Executive Order N‑60‑20) ([Link](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/5.7.20-attested-SH-Order.pdf#:~:text=The%20State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20issued%20this%20order))
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 ([Link](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPHDocumentLibrary/COVID-19/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=Executive%20Order%20N-07-21))
  – Rescinded By: A subsequent “Beyond Blueprint” order (June 11, 2021) formally rescinded the earlier order.
  – Summary: With a slight plateau in COVID‑19 case rates during spring 2020, California initiated Stage 2 reopening. Under this order, lower‑risk businesses (such as certain retail stores and suppliers) were permitted to reopen with modifications—for example, curbside pickup was allowed—while higher‑risk establishments remained closed. This order allowed for a tentative reopening in Q3 2020, but many businesses would soon see restrictions tightened again as the summer surge unfolded. For Camarillo businesses, the Stage 2 reopening provided a brief window of eased restrictions against a backdrop of rapidly changing conditions.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 ([Link](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPHDocumentLibrary/COVID-19/7.13.20-attested-EO.pdf#:~:text=On%20July%2013%2C%202020))
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; later formally rescinded on June 15, 2021
  – Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Blueprint” Order issued August 28, 2020 (and later the Beyond Blueprint Order in June 2021)
  – Summary: Facing a significant resurgence of COVID‑19 in July 2020, California re‑imposed restrictions that rolled back many aspects of the earlier reopening. Indoor operations for restaurants (except for outdoor dining), gyms, bars, and nonessential indoor businesses were once again closed. As a result, many Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June 2020 were forced to revert to limited or outdoor‑only operations in July. This rollback was directly in response to increasing case numbers and underscores why Q3 2020 remained challenging for local business owners.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color‑Tier Reopening System”
  – Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  – Date Enacted: Announced on August 28, 2020 and effective August 31, 2020 ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom))
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (with the “Beyond Blueprint” order)
  – Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021
  – Summary: This framework replaced earlier binary restrictions with a graded, color‑coded (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) system that assigned counties a tier based on local COVID‑19 metrics. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier as of August 31, 2020, meaning that many indoor business operations were still disallowed. For businesses in Q3 2020, the Blueprint system meant that even though some state‑wide restrictions were eased compared to the absolute “Stay‑at‑Home” order, local metrics still forced many businesses in Camarillo to operate at low indoor capacity or outdoors only. The tier system was intended to allow gradual reopening—and when local conditions improved, some easing occurred—but during most of Q3 2020, restrictions remained high.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – (Termination of Stay‑at‑Home/Tiers)
  – Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)
  – Date Enacted: June 11, 2021; effective June 15, 2021 ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf))
  – Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order ended all prior business‐closure mandates)
  – Rescinded By: This order itself terminated the previous restrictions while the state of emergency continued
  – Summary: This final order marked the end of the statewide mandates that had kept business operations severely limited. By June 15, 2021, with falling case numbers and increasing vaccination rates, restrictions such as capacity limits, physical distancing, and the county tier system were lifted. Although Q3 2020 businesses had to operate under very strict limitations for months, this order eventually allowed Camarillo businesses to return to near-normal operating conditions. The contrast between the painful restrictions during Q3 2020 and the reopening in mid‑2021 highlights the long‑lasting impact of earlier orders on the local economy.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  – Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of))
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active; eventually ended in 2022)
  – Rescinded By: A Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution terminating the emergency (after our period)
  – Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Health Officer declared a local health emergency, providing the legal authority to issue subsequent health orders. This declaration itself did not limit business operations but enabled the county to enforce and supplement state mandates locally. Throughout Q3 2020, the local emergency status remained in force, meaning that the county could continue to take local actions to protect public health that in turn affected businesses in Camarillo. It set a tone of urgency and facilitated coordination with state orders.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  – Order Date: March 17, 2020 ([Link](https://www.aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing))
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020
  – Rescinded By: The March 20, 2020 “Stay Well at Home” order
  – Summary: Before the state‑wide order went into effect, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions on gatherings and certain businesses on March 17, 2020. This order required vulnerable populations to shelter in place and immediately closed venues like bars, gyms, and theaters. Although quickly incorporated into later county orders, it set an early precedent for the aggressive steps taken locally. Its early implementation reflects the county’s proactive strategy—one that continued through Q3 2020 with subsequent orders and adjustments.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay‑Home Order”
  – Order Date: March 20, 2020 ([Link](https://www.aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On%20March%2020%2C%202020))
  – Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (with alignment to state reopening)
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions ([Link](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1)%20Executive%20Order%20N-33-20))
  – Summary: This order mandated that all Ventura County residents remain at home except for essential needs, effectively shutting down non‑essential in‑person business activities. In Camarillo, this meant that businesses not on the state’s essential list had to immediately cease in‑person operations, leading to significant economic contraction. As the framework for later reopening, many of the protocols and restrictions enacted in this order endured in modified form throughout Q3 2020, continually affecting business operations.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
  – Order Dates: March 31, 2020 (extension); April 9, 2020 (added gathering ban and safety protocols); April 20, 2020 (further extension)
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by a May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 order
  – Summary: As the pandemic evolved in early 2020, the county updated the stay‑home order several times—extending its duration and incorporating strict social distancing and gathering bans. These changes mandated that even essential businesses adhere to rigorous protocols, including posted safety plans and reduced entry limits. Although these specific orders were replaced by reopening orders in May, they left a lasting imprint on operational procedures in Q3 2020. Many Camarillo businesses continued to enforce mask‑wearing, distancing, and capacity restrictions that originated from these early protocols.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
  – Order Dates: Initially May 7, 2020, with an amendment on May 20, 2020 ([Link](https://www.aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=A,Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form))
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint order (August 31, 2020) and ultimately ending with the June 15, 2021 state reopening
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 and then the state order ending restrictions
  – Summary: In early May 2020, the county shifted from strict lockdown to a tentative reopening mode, permitting certain lower‑risk businesses to resume operations under strict safety guidelines. For example, curbside pickup, manufacturing for retail, and even dine‑in services (with reduced capacity and sanitation measures) were allowed following the May 20 amendment. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that by early summer some operations resumed—but always under the looming possibility of further rollbacks if cases surged. The cautious reopening provided a partial relief in Q3 2020, even as later restrictions (in July) forced many of these gains to be reversed.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  – Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend ([Link](https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close))
  – Date Rescinded: Order expired after July 5, 2020
  – Rescinded By: The order was limited in duration and automatically expired
  – Summary: To prevent large gatherings during the Independence Day weekend amid rising case numbers, Ventura County ordered the closure of beaches and prohibited use of beach parking lots for that holiday. Although the effect was temporary, it forced a significant drop in tourism and related business activity in nearby areas. Even though Camarillo is inland, reduced holiday travel and associated consumer spending had ripple effects on local businesses in Q3 2020.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) ([Link](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health))
  – Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved to a lower tier
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order issued October 6, 2020
  – Summary: In direct response to the statewide rollback on July 13, 2020, Ventura County enforced local restrictions that re‑closed many indoor operations (gyms, personal care services, places of worship, etc.). This meant that Camarillo-based businesses in these sectors had to suspend indoor operations even if they had reopened briefly in late May/June. The strict local order remained in force through much of Q3 2020, contributing to a second shutdown phase that deeply affected many service‑based and hospitality businesses.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  – Order Date: October 6, 2020 ([Link](https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring))
  – Date Rescinded: Effective changes were later overridden by a December 2020 Regional Stay‑At‑Home Order and subsequent changes in January 2021
  – Rescinded By: Superseded by later orders as the region’s metrics changed (and finally by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening)
  – Summary: With a decline in local COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County moved from the Purple to the Red tier on October 6, 2020, allowing some industries (gyms, worship services, personal care, etc.) to resume indoor operations under strict protocols. Although the easing happened at the tail end of Q3 2020, it was preceded by a challenging period during July–September when many businesses had remained closed due to the summer surge. For Camarillo, the forthcoming reopening was seen as a hopeful sign—though it was short‑lived as outbreaks returned in subsequent months.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  – Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)
  – Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020) ([Link](https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Temporary%20Eviction%20Moratoriums))
  – Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; residential protections later transferred to state law (AB 3088) effective September 1, 2020
  – Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on August 31, 2020; commercial provisions were allowed to expire per county records
  – Summary: In response to severe financial hardship, Ventura County enacted an eviction moratorium that temporarily blocked evictions for both residential and certain commercial tenants facing non‑payment of rent due to COVID‑19. For businesses in Camarillo that were renting commercial spaces, this measure provided a critical reprieve that allowed them to defer rent payments without the immediate threat of eviction. Although it did not forgive the debt, delaying evictions meant that many small businesses could weather the economic downturn during Q3 2020. This policy was an important lifeline amid ongoing uncertainty, easing one of the financial pressures on struggling business owners.

─────────────────────────────  
City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  – Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 ([Link](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%2C%20California%20%E2%80%93%20Camarillo%20City))
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect into 2021; lifted in 2022)
  – Rescinded By: A Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (after our timeframe)
  – Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency, activating its Emergency Operations Center and empowering the city to quickly implement measures such as closing public facilities and canceling events. The emergency declaration also paved the way for subsequent city‑level directives designed to support public health and, indirectly, to modify how local businesses operated. In Q3 2020, the city’s emergency status meant that Camarillo could continue to enforce or adopt policies that affected business operations, ranging from permitting modifications to supplemental local eviction protections. It underscored the city’s acknowledgment of the ongoing crisis and enabled a tailored local response.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  – Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (March 18, 2020) with an amendment on April 23, 2020 ([Link](https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases#:~:text=Camarillo%20City))
  – Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (with amendment on April 23, 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (residential protections by September 2020) and ended with the local emergency termination for any remaining commercial aspects
  – Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (for residential tenants) and later Camarillo’s termination of emergency orders in 2022
  – Summary: To protect tenants amid economic disruptions, Camarillo issued orders that temporarily barred evictions for those unable to pay rent due to COVID‑19. These measures applied to both residential properties and small business commercial leases within the city limits, helping prevent sudden closures that might have resulted from evictions. For Q3 2020, this protection meant that many Camarillo businesses had a buffer against losing their physical locations due to rent arrears, even though the deferred amounts still needed eventual repayment. Such measures were crucial as businesses struggled with sharply reduced revenues.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  – Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)
  – Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (approximately June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed)
  – Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules resumed
  – Summary: Recognizing the challenges that restaurants faced when indoor dining was either prohibited or severely limited, the City of Camarillo adopted Resolution 2020‑63 in early June 2020. This measure waived certain zoning fees and relaxed parking and permit requirements to allow restaurants to quickly establish temporary outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots, or other open spaces. In Q3 2020, many restaurants in Camarillo depended on these outdoor dining arrangements to generate revenue when indoor dining was either restricted or re‑closed due to subsequent orders. The initiative served as a critical economic support, enabling restaurants to continue operations despite strict health directives.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
  – Dates: Various times in 2020 (spring through summer)
  – Summary: In addition to emergency declarations and eviction moratoria, the City of Camarillo implemented a series of supportive measures during the pandemic. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, transitioning permit processes online to minimize in‑person contact, and promoting take‑out dining to support local restaurants. Although not all of these were formal “orders,” they were part of the comprehensive local COVID‑19 response that directly impacted how Camarillo businesses structured their operations throughout Q3 2020.

Overall Reflection on Q3 2020 Impacts

The extraordinary patchwork of orders across federal, state, county, and city levels meant that during Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo operated under a regime of rapid policy changes and uncertainty. Many were forced to shift to limited capacity, rely on outdoor operations, or face repeated closures due to resurgence measures. The various eviction moratoria, while offering temporary relief, only postponed the underlying financial pressures. Ultimately, the combination of sustained public health constraints, evolving reopening guidelines, and economic relief measures together explain why Q3 2020 was one of the most challenging quarters for local businesses.
