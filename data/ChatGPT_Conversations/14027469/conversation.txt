Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, dates of enactment and rescission (or details on superseding), and a summary of its provisions – especially regarding Q3 2020 conditions.

─────────────────────────────  
Federal Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”
  - Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during the 2020–2021 period (it remained in effect during that time; later terminated by Congress in 2023, which is beyond our scope)  
  - Rescinded By: Later congressional action (after the period of interest)  
  - Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers (including access to funding) and set the stage for subsequent state and local health orders. Although it did not prescribe direct mandates for businesses, it provided the legal and funding framework that allowed state and local authorities to impose stricter measures. In Q3 2020, while federal action itself did not close businesses, the ongoing national emergency context meant that federal stimulus and support programs were available, even as local orders kept many operations limited.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel  
  - Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (via Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later ended in 2022 by a court order)  
  - Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 (outside the 2020–2021 period)  
  - Summary: Although not directly targeting business operations, the new mask mandates applied to air travel, train and bus stations, and federal properties. These federal rules helped set the standard for safe travel and indirectly influenced business-related travel and operations. In Q3 2020 these mandates did not yet affect Camarillo businesses (since they came into effect in early 2021), but they exemplify the federal government’s evolving approach to managing the COVID-19 crisis.

California State Orders
─────────────────────────────

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID-19 State of Emergency”
  - Order Number: Not applicable (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  - Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
    Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%E2%80%93As%20part%20of%20the%20state’s
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout that period; it was formally ended in February 2023)  
  - Rescinded By: A later proclamation (outside the 2020–2021 timeframe)  
  - Summary: Governor Newsom’s proclamation on March 4, 2020, declared a state of emergency in California, which empowered state authorities to accelerate the response to the pandemic. This declaration provided legal authority for sweeping orders including business restrictions, enabling agencies to dispense regulatory relief and mobilize resources. For businesses in Q3 2020, the state emergency meant that all subsequent public health orders had a robust legal footing. The ongoing emergency status justified continued restrictive measures that affected capacity and operations in Camarillo.
  
• Executive Order N-33-20 – “Statewide Stay-at-Home Order”
  - Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
    Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019,%202020
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by Executive Order N-07-21 on June 11, 2021 which terminated the Stay-at-Home Order effective June 15, 2021)  
  - Rescinded By: EO N-07-21 (June 11, 2021) and later phased reopening orders  
  - Summary: This order mandated that all Californians stay at home except for essential activities. It forced non-essential businesses (restaurants, retail, gyms, etc.) to either close or operate at a minimum level. In Q3 2020, while some reopening was underway, many restrictions imposed by this order (or its modifying successors) continued to limit business functions such as indoor dining and full-capacity operations. The continued presence of this order during Q3 was due to the sustained risk and fluctuating local case numbers.
  
• State Public Health Officer Order – “Stage 2 Reopening Order” (May 7, 2020)
  - Order Date: May 7, 2020 (issued as part of early reopening efforts under Executive Order N-60-20)  
    Link: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order)
  - Rescinded By: A subsequent order called the “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)
  - Summary: This May 7 order was part of California’s initial steps in reopening. It allowed lower-risk businesses (such as curbside pickup retail and manufacturing elements of the supply chain) to resume operations, while more vulnerable sectors like dine-in restaurants remained closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this order helped pave the way for a tentative reopening during the summer months – though many operations were still affected by capacity limits and safety protocols. The order represented an attempt to balance economic revival with public health imperatives.
  
• State Public Health Officer Order – “July 13, 2020 Rollback Order”
  - Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Effectively replaced on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  - Rescinded By: The State’s Blueprint Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 order  
  - Summary: In response to a surge in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, California re-imposed stricter lockdown measures on sectors that had reopened in Stage 2. This order forced the closure of many indoor operations (restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters, etc.) and had a dramatic impact on Q3 2020 business operations. Businesses that had begun to reopen in May and June were forced to scale back or shut down again in July. The rollback was a direct consequence of rising infection rates and served as an “emergency brake” on economic activity during that quarter.
  
• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” – Color-Tier Reopening System
  - Order: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020), effective August 31, 2020  
    Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom
  - Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order)  
  - Rescinded By: The June 15, 2021 “Beyond Blueprint” Order that ended the tiered restrictions  
  - Summary: California’s Blueprint introduced a risk-based, color-coded system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) to regulate the reopening of businesses. Each county’s tier was determined by local infections and testing positivity. For Ventura County – and hence Camarillo – the county was in the Purple tier (the most restrictive) at the start of the Blueprint system. This meant that even though the blanket July closures were lifted, many businesses still faced heavy limitations (for example, only outdoor dining was permitted). As public health conditions improved later in the year, the tier status eased, but for most of Q3 2020, the restrictive tier system meant that businesses operated under tight conditions.
  
• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order
  - Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021; effective June 15, 2021)  
    Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the
  - Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  - Date Rescinded: Not applicable, as this order ended the previous restrictions  
  - Rescinded By: This order itself terminated the prior COVID business closures and tier framework  
  - Summary: With improving public health metrics and increasing vaccination coverage, this order marked California’s full reopening. It formally terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home Order as well as the Blueprint system, lifting most restrictions on business capacity and operations. In retrospect, the fact that these sweeping measures were not fully rescinded until mid-2021 underscores how much businesses in Q3 2020 had to operate under ongoing restrictions and limited activity.

Ventura County Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency
  - Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
    Link: (For example, see Ventura County documents such as those from Gov’tnor Newsom’s related press releases and local health officer pages.)
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained active and was only ended in 2022)  
  - Rescinded By: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution (in 2022)  
  - Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County declared a local health emergency which provided the legal foundation for subsequent public health orders. While the declaration itself did not impose direct business restrictions, it enabled the county’s health officer to issue orders such as stay-at-home mandates. In Q3 2020, this emergency status meant that the county continued to have authority to enforce various restrictions affecting businesses in Camarillo.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order – March 17, 2020 (Initial Order)
  - Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 (by the “Stay Well at Home” order) and later formally repealed by subsequent orders  
  - Rescinded By: The March 20, 2020 order issued by the Ventura County Health Officer  
  - Summary: This initial local order directed residents (especially vulnerable populations) to shelter in place and required the closure of certain public facilities and non-essential businesses. Although quickly replaced by broader mandates, it set the tone for the county’s aggressive response. The early measures helped establish a baseline for public expectations and enforcement that carried into later months, influencing how Q3 2020 restrictions were applied.
  
• Ventura County “Stay Well at Home” Order
  - Order Date: March 20, 2020  
    Link: (For example: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=PUBLIC%20HEALTH%20AND%20UNDER%20THE,are%20hereby)
  - Date Rescinded: Formally lifted with local updates on June 15, 2021 (aligned with state reopening)  
  - Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated June 15, 2021
  - Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs, effectively closing non-essential businesses. It was the local companion to the state’s March 19 stay-at-home mandate. In Q3 2020, while the strict stay-at-home order had been modified to allow for partial reopenings, its foundational restrictions still influenced business operations (such as indoor capacity limits and safety protocols). The order remained influential because the public health situation had not yet improved enough to restore full pre-pandemic operations.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)
  - Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
    Link: (For example: https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7)
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Safely Reopening” order on May 7, 2020
  - Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020
  - Summary: Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County extended its stay-at-home order and added further social distancing protocols and gathering bans. Although these specific orders were no longer in force by the summer, they set in place many of the health and safety practices (masking, social distancing, capacity limits) that persisted in Q3 2020. They are important in understanding how businesses accepted and then later modified operations under these initial strict conditions.
  
• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order
  - Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amended)  
    Link: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=with%20Executive%20Order%20N-60-20
  - Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint order (Aug. 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening order  
  - Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated August 31, 2020 (as the county aligned with the state Blueprint tier)  
  - Summary: In May 2020, Ventura County shifted its strategy to a safe reopening model that allowed certain non-essential businesses to resume operations under strict health guidelines. This order enabled lower-risk sectors (such as curbside retail and manufacturing) to reopen and later allowed dine-in service at restaurants (albeit at reduced capacity and with extensive COVID protocols). For Q3 2020 businesses, especially those in the food service and retail sectors, this order made reopening possible—but many operations remained precarious as restrictions were later reimposed when infections surged again in July.
  
• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order (Beach Closure Order)
  - Order Date: Announced on June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
  - Date Rescinded: The order expired after July 5, 2020  
  - Rescinded By: The closure was temporary by design and expired automatically  
  - Summary: In anticipation of heavy crowds during the Independence Day weekend, many Ventura County beaches were ordered closed to curb the risk of super-spreader events. Although Camarillo is inland, this decision impacted related tourism and any business linked to coastal recreation by reducing foot traffic and spending. The temporary nature of this order underscores the short-term disruptions businesses could face even if they were otherwise open.
  
• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback Measures
  - Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  - Date Rescinded: Portions were rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved into the Red tier  
  - Rescinded By: A Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  - Summary: To enforce the state’s July 13 rollback, Ventura County issued an order closing indoor operations for a variety of sectors such as gyms, places of worship, and personal care services. In Q3 2020, this meant that even businesses that had reopened in May/June were forced to shut indoor areas again in July. The restrictions were driven by the summer surge in cases and had a major economic impact on local businesses.
  
• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order
  - Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Later revised by state/county measures (with subsequent orders in December 2020 and January 2021), and ultimately all local restrictions ended with the June 15, 2021 reopening  
  - Rescinded By: Superseded by later strict orders (such as the December Regional Stay-at-Home) and eventually by the June 15, 2021 statewide reopening  
  - Summary: By October 2020, improved conditions allowed Ventura County to transition into the less restrictive Red tier. This order allowed the resumption of indoor operations for some sectors (gyms, houses of worship, personal care) but under strict capacity and health guidelines. For businesses coming out of Q3 2020, the order signaled the beginning of recovery, although many of the gains were short-lived as worsening conditions forced further restrictions by December.
  
• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium
  - Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  - Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (with retroactive effect to March 2020)  
    Link: (For example: https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Temporary%20Eviction%20Moratoriums)
  - Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; for residential, later replaced by state law (AB 3088) effective September 1, 2020  
  - Rescinded By: For residential tenants, by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088); for commercial, by Ventura County decisions (or after the expiration date)  
  - Summary: To alleviate the financial strain on tenants including small businesses, Ventura County imposed a moratorium on evictions. This measure prevented landlords in unincorporated areas from evicting tenants who lost income due to the pandemic. For Q3 2020, this protection was vital as many businesses experienced severe downturns in revenue yet still faced fixed rent obligations.
  
─────────────────────────────  
City of Camarillo Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation
  - Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution No. 20-36)  
  - Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (was only lifted in 2022)  
  - Rescinded By: A later City Council resolution (in 2022)  
  - Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID-19. This proclamation activated the Emergency Operations Center and allowed the city to deploy emergency measures—including closing city facilities and canceling public events. For local businesses, the continued state of emergency throughout 2020 meant that city-level protective and restrictive measures (as well as municipal relief efforts) remained in force, affecting operations in Q3 2020.
  
• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders
  - Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and its Amendment (April 23, 2020)  
  - Date Enacted: Initially March 18, 2020; amended April 23, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, later preempted by state law on August 31, 2020; for any remaining city provisions (such as for commercial tenants), tied to the duration of the local emergency  
  - Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (for residential) and the eventual termination of the local emergency  
  - Summary: Camarillo’s local eviction moratorium protected tenants—including businesses renting city property—from immediate eviction due to COVID-related income loss. This measure helped small businesses avoid losing their locations during the economic slowdowns of the pandemic. In Q3 2020, this protection was a key factor in economic survival, even though it did not eliminate the eventual accumulation of rent arrears.
  
• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program
  - Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
  - Date Rescinded: Expired effectively when full indoor dining resumed (around June 15, 2021) or when normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022  
  - Rescinded By: Automatic sunset tied to the termination of COVID-19 capacity restrictions  
  - Summary: Recognizing the need for restaurants to serve customers while indoor dining remained restricted, Camarillo City Council passed Resolution No. 2020-63 to waive certain zoning fees and allow temporary outdoor dining setups in parking lots, on sidewalks, and in other open spaces. This measure enabled restaurants to continue operating by expanding their dining areas outdoors under health safety guidelines. In Q3 2020, when many restaurants could only offer limited service, this resolution provided critical economic relief and helped sustain the local food service industry.
  
• Miscellaneous City Measures
  - Dates: Various across spring to summer 2020  
  - Summary: In addition to major orders, Camarillo took further steps such as suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online, and launching take-out promotion campaigns. These measures were designed to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and provide economic support during a time when normal city services were disrupted by the pandemic. Collectively, these efforts contributed to a modified operating environment for local businesses in Q3 2020.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Summary for Q3 2020:
─────────────────────────────

Across all levels—federal, state, county, and city—COVID-19 related orders during 2020–2021 had a profound impact on business operations in Camarillo. In Q3 2020, many businesses faced:
  
– Continued restrictions on indoor operations due to statewide stay-at-home orders and subsequent rollbacks when cases surged (as seen in both the state’s and Ventura County’s orders).  
– A patchwork of reopening measures (such as the Stage 2 and Blueprint orders) that allowed limited operations but imposed strict safety and capacity protocols.  
– Economic pressure from intermittent closures and reduced capacity, balanced somewhat by eviction moratoriums and local relief measures (including temporary outdoor dining measures in Camarillo).  
– An ongoing sense of uncertainty – with orders repeatedly imposed, lifted, and then sometimes reinstated in response to fluctuating case numbers—forcing businesses to remain agile and often operate at diminished levels.

The overarching reason Q3 2020 was so disruptive was that, although initial re-openings generated hope, the summer surge in COVID-19 cases forced many restrictions to be reimposed. This roller coaster created a uniquely challenging environment for local businesses that had to continuously adapt to rapidly changing public health mandates.
