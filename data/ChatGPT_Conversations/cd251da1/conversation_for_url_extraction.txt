COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on February 24, 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  Summary:  
  This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and authorized funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses operated under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency—meaning that while federal stimulus aid and recommendations were available, strict state and local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit operations.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC Order effective February 1, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A court order dated April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside the 2020–2021 period)  
  Summary:  
  Although not directed toward closing businesses, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order—and the subsequent CDC order—required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, in airports, and on federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, these mandates had no direct effect (since they began in early 2021) but demonstrate the continuation of a federal response into that period. By mid-2021—as vaccines were rolled out—the federal focus shifted from blanket closures to safe operational protocols.
  (For more context on federal response, note that the primary restrictions on Camarillo businesses during 2020 were driven by state and local orders.)

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: Not applicable – Governor’s Proclamation  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout this period)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by a later gubernatorial proclamation (outside the scope here)  
  Summary:  
  Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 to marshal resources, suspend certain laws, and mobilize state agencies. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses—for example, by ordering closures and later regulating reopening measures. In Q3 2020, this emergency underpinned all California COVID orders, meaning that businesses had to follow rapidly changing directives, receive regulatory relief, and in some cases apply for funding. Its continued active status throughout 2020 was a key reason that wide-ranging public health orders stayed in force into Q3.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021) formally terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home order  
  Summary:  
  This sweeping lockdown order required all Californians to stay at home except for essential needs and employment in critical sectors. It forced “non-essential” businesses (such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, and theaters) to either close or operate at minimal capacity while allowing “essential” businesses (like grocery stores, pharmacies, and banks) to remain open under precautions. In Q3 2020, although the direct effects of the original March order had evolved as phased reopenings began, many Camarillo businesses still operated under restrictions directly arising from this order. For example, restaurants continued to serve only outdoor or takeout options because the original mandate still governed operations.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying the Stay-at-Home  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under Executive Order N-60-20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order)  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Summary:  
  As case rates plateaued in the spring, California initiated “Stage 2” of reopening. This order relaxed the March stay-at-home restrictions and allowed lower-risk businesses to reopen on a limited basis. For instance, many retail stores could reopen with curbside pickup and supply chains restarted. However, higher-risk establishments (such as dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, these orders initiated the gradual reopening approach and set the conditions that later led to summertime operations—only to be partially reversed in July when case numbers surged again.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the Beyond Blueprint Order  
  Summary:  
  In response to a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, the State Health Officer re-imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. This order closed many indoor operations that had been permitted during Stage 2 of reopening. For example, restaurants were forced to cease indoor dining (though outdoor dining and takeout continued) and venues such as gyms, bars, and movie theaters were closed again. In Q3 2020, many businesses that had reopened in May or June were forced to shut down or limit operations in July, leading to significant revenue losses for establishments in Camarillo.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Beyond Blueprint” Order that terminated the tier system  
  Summary:  
  California introduced the Blueprint for a Safer Economy as a long-term, risk-based, color-tier system for regulating business operations. Counties were assigned tiers (Purple for widespread risk, Red for substantial, Orange for moderate, Yellow for minimal) based on local COVID-19 metrics. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, entered the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that many indoor business operations (such as indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters) were still prohibited or allowed only under very strict capacity limits during Q3 2020. As conditions improved, Ventura County later moved into the Red tier by October, easing some restrictions; however, during most of Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo faced heavy restrictions due to the county’s placement in the Purple tier.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in the Southern California region on December 6, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The state’s announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order once ICU projections improved  
  Summary:  
  In late 2020, facing a severe winter surge, California introduced a Regional Stay-at-Home Order tied to ICU bed availability. In regions where ICU capacity dropped below a 15% threshold (which included parts of Southern California such as Ventura County), stringent lockdown measures were re-imposed. These measures forced closures or severe limitations on a wide range of business sectors—for instance, restaurants were restricted to takeout only, personal care services fully closed, and retail capacity was dramatically limited. Although the order took effect in Q4 2020, its existence underscored the precarious nature of the business environment in Q3 2020, demonstrating that even if restrictions seemed to ease temporarily in the summer, the threat of a resurgence loomed large.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Not applicable, as this order itself ended prior restrictions  
  Rescinded By: This order rescinded the previous Stay-at-Home and Blueprint tier framework orders  
  Summary:  
  These orders marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021 by formally terminating the earlier restrictions such as EO N-33-20 and retiring the Blueprint system. While the state of emergency technically continued, the operating constraints on businesses (e.g., capacity limits and distancing requirements) were largely lifted. In contrast, Q3 2020 was characterized by ongoing restrictions that were only fully ended nearly a year later, emphasizing the prolonged hardship experienced by Camarillo businesses during that quarter.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained active; ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022)  
  Summary:  
  On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency. This declaration provided the legal basis for subsequent county health orders and for mobilizing local resources to respond to the outbreak. In Q3 2020, the ongoing health emergency gave Ventura County the authority to continue enforcing regulations that affected Camarillo businesses.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s order of March 20, 2020  
  Summary:  
  Before the statewide mandate, Ventura County issued an order instructing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and directing the early closure of certain businesses and public facilities. Venues such as bars, gyms, and theaters were closed, setting a precedent for rapid local action. Although this order was replaced by broader directives by late March, it set the tone for ongoing county efforts that influenced Q3 2020 restrictions.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-at-Home Directive  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in line with state reopening)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions  
  Summary:  
  This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities. It closed virtually all non-essential businesses and activities in the county, directly impacting Camarillo businesses by forcing them to cease normal in-person operations. Although modified reopenings began later in the summer, the core restrictions continued to affect business capacity and operations throughout Q3 2020.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates:  
    - March 31, 2020: Extended the stay-home order to April 19, 2020  
    - April 9, 2020: Added gathering ban and safety protocols  
    - April 20, 2020: Further extended the order through May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order  
  Summary:  
  Throughout early 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its Stay Well at Home directive. These updates introduced additional restrictions such as bans on gatherings and requirements for social distancing and safety protocols in open businesses. Although these updates were replaced by the reopening framework in May, the safety protocols and capacity limits they introduced still influenced Q3 2020 operations by establishing standards that reopened businesses continued to follow.
  
• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates:  
    - May 7, 2020: Initial order repealing stricter prior orders  
    - May 20, 2020: Amendment to allow dine-in restaurants and in-store retail with precautions  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded later by the state’s Blueprint (effective August 31, 2020) and then by the June 15, 2021 full reopening  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated August 31, 2020 and ultimately the June 15, 2021 state order  
  Summary:  
  As conditions improved in early May 2020, Ventura County began a phased reopening. The May 7 order replaced earlier, stricter orders, and the May 20 amendment allowed more businesses—including dine-in restaurants—to reopen with COVID safety measures in place. For many Camarillo businesses, these orders were critical; they enabled a cautious return to operations in Q3 2020, although many sectors had to contend with the subsequent re-imposition of restrictions in July.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (for July 3–5, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (expired by its terms)  
  Rescinded By: The order’s own time limits  
  Summary:  
  In anticipation of crowding during the Independence Day weekend amid rising cases, Ventura County ordered local beaches and beach parking lots closed for the holiday weekend. Although Camarillo is inland, this order affected regional tourism and the associated economic activity that nearby coastal businesses rely on, thereby indirectly impacting consumer spending in the area during one of the busiest holiday periods.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved into a less restrictive tier)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated October 6, 2020  
  Summary:  
  In response to the statewide rollback issued on July 13, 2020, Ventura County implemented its own order to enforce the closure of indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care businesses. As a result, many Camarillo establishments in these sectors were forced to close their indoor services, although some outdoor operations were permitted. This local order remained in effect for most of Q3 2020, contributing to the challenging operating environment during that quarter.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (later superseded by the Regional Stay-at-Home Order in December 2020 and then a return to more restrictive conditions in January 2021)  
  Rescinded By: The December 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order and subsequent state orders eventually replaced these local measures  
  Summary:  
  By early October 2020, improved local conditions allowed Ventura County to move into the less restrictive Red tier. The Health Officer’s order on October 6 permitted certain indoor operations (such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care businesses) to resume service under strict protocols. For Q3 2020 businesses, especially those operating in the later part of the quarter (September), this provided a sign of hope for easing restrictions, even though many hardships were still experienced due to the previous months of stringent closures.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial passage on March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, ended September 30, 2020; for residential, replaced by California AB 3088 (effective September 1, 2020)  
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088); for commercial tenants, the county allowed the protection to expire as scheduled  
  Summary:  
  In recognition of the severe economic hardship caused by the pandemic, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors approved an urgency ordinance to prevent evictions of both residential and small-business (commercial) tenants unable to pay rent due to COVID-19 losses. For Camarillo businesses, this moratorium offered critical protection during Q3 2020 by delaying forced evictions even as income decreased dramatically. Although rent was not forgiven, the temporary relief helped many business tenants remain in their locations during one of the toughest economic periods.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified as City Council Resolution 20-36)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained in effect into 2021; formally ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution (April 2022, outside the current timeframe)  
  Summary:  
  The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020, activating its Emergency Operations Center and enabling a rapid local response. Under this proclamation, city facilities were closed, and public events were canceled. For businesses in Q3 2020, the continued state of local emergency allowed Camarillo to enforce COVID-related rules—affecting everything from permit processing to the organization of outdoor spaces.
  
• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (issued March 18, 2020) and its amendment on April 23, 2020  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (residential protections via AB 3088 in August/September 2020) and eventually ended when the local emergency concluded  
  Rescinded By: California’s COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) and later local resolutions ending the emergency  
  Summary:  
  Camarillo quickly acted to protect its tenants by preventing evictions for those unable to pay rent due to pandemic-related income loss. The local eviction moratorium applied to both residential and commercial properties within the city. For Q3 2020 businesses, this meant that if they suffered revenue losses and fell behind on rent, they had temporary protection from eviction—helping to ease the financial shock during the height of restrictions.
  
• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Effectively ceased when normal zoning rules returned (approximately June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed)  
  Rescinded By: Automatic sunset with the end of the COVID capacity restrictions and local emergency  
  Summary:  
  To aid restaurants struggling under indoor dining closures, Camarillo adopted Resolution 2020-63. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees, allowing restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. In Q3 2020, when state orders sometimes forced indoor dining closures (such as in July), this resolution enabled establishments to continue serving customers outdoors—thereby mitigating revenue losses.

  https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020-63

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring through summer)  
  Summary:  
  In addition to the above orders, the City of Camarillo took other actions to support local businesses during the pandemic. These measures included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online for construction projects, and promoting take-out dining campaigns to support restaurants. Although not formal “orders,” these steps were part of the city’s overall response framework and influenced the operating environment for private businesses during Q3 2020.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Reflection

Across all levels—from federal declarations and state executive orders to county directives and local city resolutions—the COVID-19 pandemic produced an unprecedented patchwork of restrictions and relief measures. For businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020, the lingering effects of early lockdown orders, re-imposed closures during the summer surge, and the evolving reopening frameworks meant that operations were often severely limited. Measures such as the eviction moratoriums and outdoor dining programs provided crucial economic support amid deep uncertainty. The combined federal, state, county, and city actions illustrate the complex regulatory landscape that businesses had to navigate during this challenging quarter.
