RE: Formal Protest to ERC Disallowance for Quarter 1 2021  
Tax Period: Quarter 1 2021  

Dear Appeals Officer,

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing 45's Business’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for Quarter 1 2021. The disallowance was based on an assertion that no government orders were in effect during this period that caused a suspension or significant limitation of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Our business—a law firm located in Unknown Location, NY—experienced both a dramatic revenue decline and continued operational restrictions necessitated by numerous federal, state, county, and city government orders. In this protest, we provide a comprehensive timeline of the applicable government orders and a detailed “REVENUE DECLINE DATA” section with the exact audit‐critical revenue figures that support our ERC qualification.

Below is a chronological timeline of COVID‑19 related government orders that, directly or indirectly, imposed restrictions and mandated modifications to our operations in Quarter 1 2021.

REVENUE DECLINE DATA

This section details the exact revenue comparisons used to substantiate the significant decline experienced by 45's Business during the COVID‑19 impacted periods. The following narrative presents the audit‑critical revenue figures for the quarter being protested, along with additional qualifying quarters.

In Q1 2021, 45's Business reported EXACTLY $345 in revenue, compared to Q1 2019 which reported EXACTLY $54325234. This represents an EXACT decline of $54324889, or an EXACT 100.00% decline. Based on the ERC thresholds, this dramatic reduction in revenue clearly qualifies 45's Business for the Employee Retention Credit.

• Q2 2021: EXACTLY $345 compared to Q2 2019: EXACTLY $3552452345 = EXACTLY 100.00% decline (Qualifies for ERC)  
• Q3 2021: EXACTLY $345 compared to Q3 2019: EXACTLY $3245345 = EXACTLY 99.99% decline (Qualifies for ERC)

In summary, the substantial revenue declines evidenced above, directly resulting from COVID‑19 related operational constraints, affirm that 45's Business meets the eligibility requirements for the ERC.

Conclusion and Request

Based on the overwhelming evidence of both COVID‑19 related government orders and the audit‑critical revenue decline data provided above, we respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our ERC for Quarter 1 2021. The combined impact of persistent federal, state, county, and city directives—along with the exact revenue figures demonstrating a 100.00% drop in earnings—unequivocally establishes that 45's Business qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit under the partial suspension rules.
