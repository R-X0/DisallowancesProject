─────────────────────────────  
Federal Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023, which is beyond our timeframe)  
  Rescinded By: A subsequent congressional termination in 2023  
  Summary:  
   – This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  
   – It activated extensive federal emergency powers and directed funding to aid the public health response.  
   – Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it laid the legal groundwork for state and local lockdowns.  
   – In Q3 2020, while federal intervention was not imposing closures directly, the continuing national emergency helped justify ongoing aggressive state/local measures that significantly impacted business operations in Camarillo—for example, by allowing the state to enforce later mandates with federal backing.
   – The national emergency also set expectations about the severity of the crisis, indirectly affecting business confidence and customer behavior.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (remained in effect for that year; later lifted in 2022 by a court order)  
  Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022  
  Summary:  
   – While not directly targeting business operations, these mandates required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, and federal properties.  
   – They illustrate the federal response as the administration shifted focus toward safe transit amid the pandemic.  
   – For Q3 2020 operations (which predated these mandates), businesses were primarily affected by state and local actions; however, the eventual federal focus on masking reflected an ongoing nationwide effort to contain the virus.
   – In later months of 2021, travel-related businesses would need to adapt to these mandates, though during Q3 2020 the federal orders were not yet in place.
   – Their introduction underscored the overall cautious approach to public safety that indirectly set the tone for restrictions affecting various sectors.

California State Orders
─────────────────────────────

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: (No specific order number; it was a Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (the emergency status remained active until it was ended in February 2023)  
  Rescinded By: A later proclamation in 2023  
  Summary:  
   – Governor Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency, thereby mobilizing resources and authorizing subsequent public health orders.  
   – This emergency status empowered the Governor and state agencies to implement lockdowns and business restrictions.  
   – It provided the legal basis for later orders that directly limited business operations and shaped economic relief measures.  
   – In Q3 2020, the state of emergency underpinned all orders, meaning businesses were operating under extraordinary conditions that justified limits on normal operations.
   – The sustained emergency allowed for ongoing regulatory adaptations in response to fluctuating COVID-19 case numbers.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which ended the statewide Stay-at-Home order  
  Summary:  
   – This order mandated that all individuals in California remain at home except for those engaged in essential purposes or critical infrastructure work.  
   – Non-essential businesses, such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores (if not essential), gyms, salons, and theaters, were forced to close or operate minimally.  
   – Though by Q3 2020 many restrictions were evolving and some reopening had begun, the lingering impact of this order meant that many businesses were still restricted to outdoor or low-capacity operations.  
   – The March 19 order (and the waves of modifications thereafter) contributed directly to the challenging business environment in Q3, as reopening phases were tentative and subject to rollback.
   – The order’s protracted period (and its “until further notice” language) underpinned the persistent caution in reopening strategies during Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date: May 7, 2020 (issued in connection with Executive Order N-60-20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (formally superseded by a later “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order of June 11, 2021  
  Summary:  
   – As COVID-19 cases stabilized in the spring, California began a phased reopening by relaxing the strict March stay-at-home restrictions under a “Stage 2” plan.  
   – The May 7 order allowed lower-risk businesses such as retail stores (operating with curbside pickup) and certain manufacturing operations to reopen under strict safety protocols.  
   – Many higher-risk establishments, including dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons, were still closed or only allowed outdoor operations, meaning businesses in those sectors continued to face severe limits throughout Q3 2020.  
   – In Camarillo, this order set the stage for limited reopening; however, the subsequent COVID surge in summer 2020 meant that many businesses had to scale back operations shortly after reopening.  
   – It represents the balance struck between economic need and public health, with Q3 2020 businesses having to cope with sudden shifts in operating conditions.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the Blueprint tier framework on August 31, 2020; formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later the Beyond Blueprint Order  
  Summary:  
   – Amid a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, California re-imposed restrictions on many sectors that had been allowed to reopen in May and early June.  
   – The July 13 order required closure of indoor operations for many businesses: restaurants had to discontinue indoor dining (allowing only outdoor and takeout), bars, movie theaters, gyms, and other high-risk venues were ordered shut indoors.  
   – In Ventura County (which includes Camarillo), this meant that businesses which had started reopening in the early summer were forced into a second round of closures or severe capacity restrictions during Q3 2020.  
   – The order was a direct response to the surge in cases and reflects how rapidly the reopening situation could change based on public health data.  
   – For many Camarillo businesses, this rollback created substantial operational and financial challenges throughout Q3 2020.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: Announced on August 28, 2020 and effective August 31, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (when the county/state fully reopened and ended the tier system)  
  Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order of June 15, 2021  
  Summary:  
   – The Blueprint established a color-coded, risk-based tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) that dictated how many businesses could operate and under what conditions.  
   – Ventura County, and therefore Camarillo, entered the most restrictive “Purple” tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that non-essential indoor operations were heavily limited.  
   – This framework meant that even if some state-wide restrictions had eased, local conditions (determined by COVID case rates and test positivity) kept many ventures in a near-lockdown mode throughout most of Q3 2020.  
   – The system was designed to be dynamic; changes in tier levels could lead to rapid tightening or easing of restrictions, contributing to business uncertainty during Q3 2020.  
   – The Blueprint was intended as a long-term solution, but its presence in Q3 2020 meant that many businesses were still not operating at full capacity due to local public health risk.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; took effect in the Southern California region on December 6, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials announced the lifting of the Regional Stay-at-Home Order on January 25, 2021  
  Summary:  
   – In December 2020, as intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in Southern California dropped below 15%, the state ordered a Regional Stay-at-Home Order which forced even outdoor dining to be halted for restaurants, along with closure of many other non-essential businesses.  
   – Although this order officially applied in the winter (Q4 2020 into early 2021), its issuance underscored the uncertainty and unpredictability of COVID-19 case trends that had been affecting Q3 2020 as well.  
   – The threat of a renewed shutdown weighed on businesses in Q3 2020, influencing how they planned their operations and contributed to cautious investment or staffing decisions.  
   – The order’s later lifting in January 2021 marked a turning point, but during Q3 2020 the anticipation of further restrictions added to the overall stress and reduced customer turnout.
   – In essence, even if not directly in force during Q3, the looming potential of such an order affected business planning and consumer behavior at that time.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / corresponding State Health Officer Order  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (with full effect June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: This order ended previous restrictions rather than being rescinded by another order  
  Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded all earlier stay-at-home and tiered framework orders, although the underlying state emergency remained in place  
  Summary:  
   – This order marked the full reopening of California’s business sectors, abolishing the stay-at-home and Blueprint tier restrictions that had largely governed 2020–2021 operations.  
   – It lifted capacity limits, physical distancing mandates, and indoor/outdoor restrictions, allowing Camarillo businesses to return to largely pre-pandemic operation levels.  
   – In retrospect, the fact that California maintained restrictions until mid-2021 highlights how prolonged and severe the Q3 2020 environment was for businesses; had this order come earlier, Q3 would have seen a complete return to normalcy.
   – For businesses in Q3 2020, the gap between the early reopening orders and the eventual full reopening illustrates the extended period of uncertainty and limited operations.
   – It also underlines that improvements in public health metrics (which only later made “Beyond Blueprint” possible) were not achieved in Q3 2020, keeping many sectors restricted during that quarter.

─────────────────────────────  
Ventura County (Local) Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: The local emergency was not rescinded during 2020–21 (it remained effective until later, with formal termination occurring in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A subsequent Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (post-2021)  
  Summary:  
   – On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency in response to COVID-19.  
   – This declaration provided the legal authority for the county to implement additional orders and allocate emergency resources.  
   – Although the declaration itself did not directly close businesses, it paved the way for mandatory orders such as the Stay Well at Home directive.  
   – Throughout Q3 2020, the ongoing local emergency justified the county’s enforcement of strict health and safety measures that directly affected business operations in Camarillo.
   – The extended state of local emergency underscored the seriousness of the virus in the region, lending additional weight to all subsequent county-level restrictions.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures and Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the more comprehensive "Stay Well at Home" order  
  Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer’s March 20, 2020 order  
  Summary:  
   – Prior to the statewide mandate, Ventura County issued an order on March 17, 2020 that ordered vulnerable residents to shelter in place and closed certain public venues and non-essential businesses.  
   – This early action included shutting down bars, nightclubs, gyms, theaters, and limiting restaurants to takeout only.  
   – Although quickly overwritten by the state’s own directives, it set a precedent for the aggressive local response.  
   – The aggressive local approach reassured residents but also signaled to businesses that very strict closures were on the horizon.
   – The early local restrictions helped shape the sustained cautious approach that impacted Q3 2020, as businesses knew the county had a history of imposing tough measures.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-at-Home Order  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening; formally lifted by a Ventura County Health Officer update on June 15, 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated June 15, 2021  
  Summary:  
   – This county order required all residents of Ventura County to remain at home except for essential activities, closing nearly all non-essential businesses and public venues.  
   – It mirrored the statewide stay-at-home mandate and added local enforcement protocols.  
   – In practice, virtually every business operating in Camarillo was forced to halt in-person operations unless designated as essential, profoundly impacting revenue streams and operational planning through Q3 2020.  
   – Even as some reopening was attempted during the summer, many of the fundamental restrictions originated in this order, affecting how Q3 2020 business operations were structured.  
   – The lengthy life of this order, albeit with modifications, explains why Q3 2020 was marked by limited business capacities and persistent operational restrictions.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Various Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates:  
   – March 31, 2020: Extension of the Stay-at-Home order through April 19, 2020  
   – April 9, 2020: Added gathering ban and mandated safety protocols for essential businesses  
   – April 20, 2020: Further extension of stay-at-home measures through May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: These orders were gradually repealed or replaced beginning in early May 2020 as part of the “Safely Reopening” framework aligned with state guidelines  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020, which aligned county protocols with the state roadmap  
  Summary:  
   – As the initial strict orders took hold, Ventura County updated and extended its directives to include specifics on social distancing (e.g., maintaining a 6-foot distance) and clarified which activities remained prohibited.  
   – These modifications ensured that even when some businesses reopened, strict protocols governed customer interactions and facility operations.  
   – While these spring orders had by Q3 been replaced by the reopening framework, they established the baseline safety measures (masking, distancing, reduced capacity) that continued to affect Q3 operations.
   – They reflect the county’s attempt to balance reopening with the need to mitigate viral spread.
   – Businesses that re-opened in Q3 were still largely bound by the safety and capacity limitations originally set in these orders, which in turn limited revenue and altered operational practices.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening  
  Order Dates:  
   – May 7, 2020: Initial “Safely Reopening” order repealing stricter April orders  
   – May 20, 2020: Amendment expanding reopening to include dine-in restaurants and in-store retail with strict protocols  
  Date Rescinded: Eventually superseded by the state Blueprint Order on August 31, 2020 and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening orders  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 (aligning with the state Blueprint Tier) and ultimately the June 15, 2021 state order  
  Summary:  
   – As the county began to ease restrictions, the “Safely Reopening” order enabled various types of businesses to resume operations under new safety guidelines.  
   – Retail outlets, manufacturing, and logistics were allowed to reopen, with dine-in restaurants permitted at modified capacities and under strict protocols.  
   – This order was critical for businesses in Q3 2020 because it marked the transition from a blanket shutdown to a cautious reopening—even though many restrictions (and their economic impacts) lingered.
   – However, the summer surge in COVID-19 cases forced some sectors to close again in July, meaning that while this order allowed a brief revival, it was not a guarantee of continued normal operations.
   – It exemplifies the stop–start nature of reopening efforts during this period.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure  
  Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 (for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend)  
  Date Rescinded: Automatically expired on July 6, 2020 after the holiday weekend  
  Rescinded By: The order’s own terms, which made it temporary  
  Summary:  
   – In anticipation of heavy crowds during the Independence Day weekend, Ventura County ordered that beaches be closed and parking lots limited to prevent mass gatherings.  
   – This short-term measure was designed to avert potential “super-spreader” events during a peak travel holiday.  
   – Although Camarillo is inland, reduced tourism in the coastal areas impacted nearby business activity in the greater region.
   – The order is an example of the targeted, short-term directives that characterized the response during the uncertain Q3 2020 period.
   – It highlights the balancing act between reopening and the need to rapidly reimpose closures when forecasts predicted viral surges.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Portions were rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county transitioned into a lower-tier status  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  Summary:  
   – Following Governor Newsom’s July 13 statewide orders, Ventura County issued a local order to enforce the rollback of indoor operations for many sectors including gyms, places of worship, and personal care services.
   – This order forced many businesses that had cautiously begun reopening in May and June to close their indoor operations again in July.
   – In Camarillo, this meant that restaurants, salons, and fitness centers were forced to operate only outdoors (where possible) or not at all.
   – The local order remained in effect until the public health data improved enough by early fall.
   – It clearly exemplifies how the unpredictable nature of the pandemic created a challenging “roller-coaster” for business owners during Q3 2020.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Fall Restrictions  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Continued until January 25, 2021 (and later superseded by subsequent state orders)  
  Rescinded By: The December 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order and subsequent changes; ultimately by the full reopening in June 2021  
  Summary:  
   – By early October 2020, declining local COVID-19 metrics allowed Ventura County to move from the most restrictive Purple tier to the moderately restrictive Red tier.
   – The October 6 order allowed some indoor operations to resume for sectors like gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services under strict safety guidelines.
   – This order was a welcome development for businesses in late Q3 2020, as it signaled the first easing of the summer’s harsh restrictions.
   – However, as conditions worsened again in December 2020, some of these adjustments were reversed.  
   – For businesses, this short period of improvement offered a glimmer of hope and the possibility of increased revenue after a prolonged period of severe restrictions.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (with subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial passage March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; for residential evictions, later superseded by state law (California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act AB 3088) effective from September 1, 2020  
  Rescinded By: AB 3088 for residential cases and local administrative decisions for commercial cases  
  Summary:  
   – Recognizing the financial hardships caused by the pandemic, Ventura County enacted an ordinance that temporarily barred landlords from evicting residential and commercial tenants who were unable to pay rent due to COVID-induced hardships.  
   – This measure was initially extremely critical in the spring and was later extended into the summer, providing temporary relief to business tenants in Camarillo as well as residential renters.  
   – For Q3 2020, the moratorium meant that small businesses renting space could avoid the immediate threat of eviction despite significant revenue shortfalls.
   – It was an essential protective measure aimed at preventing a wave of business closures and homelessness during the height of the pandemic.
   – Although this protection was only temporary and did not forgive rent, it afforded businesses additional time to regroup or adjust to reduced income levels.

─────────────────────────────  
City of Camarillo Orders
─────────────────────────────

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: The local emergency remained effective throughout 2020–2021 (formally ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A Camarillo City Council resolution terminating the local COVID emergency (in 2022)  
  Summary:  
   – The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020 to mobilize city resources and coordinate a response to COVID-19.  
   – This declaration triggered the activation of the Emergency Operations Center and enabled rapid local measures including facility closures and event cancellations.  
   – City-run venues such as City Hall, the public library, and community centers were closed, affecting businesses that relied on city services or events for extra foot traffic.  
   – In Q3 2020, the ongoing state of emergency allowed the city to continue enforcing COVID-related rules and offer operational relief to local business owners.
   – It also reinforced public awareness of the crisis, indirectly influencing consumer behavior and business revenue.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (issued March 18, 2020) with an amendment on April 23, 2020  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, locally preempted by state law (AB 3088) effective August 31, 2020; for any remaining commercial provisions, ended with the local emergency resolution (in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: The California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential cases and later city council action  
  Summary:  
   – To protect both residents and small business tenants facing financial hardship, Camarillo issued a moratorium that prevented evictions for nonpayment related to COVID-19 losses.  
   – This provided critical relief for business owners who might otherwise have been forced to close due to lease defaults.
   – In Q3 2020, this moratorium meant that if a Camarillo business was struggling to meet rent obligations, it was shielded from immediate eviction proceedings.
   – Although it did not forgive rent, the measure allowed businesses time to attempt operational adjustments.
   – It was an important local complement to county and state efforts to mitigate the economic fallout of COVID-19.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: Early June 2020 (approximately June 10, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Effectively expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions on or around June 15, 2021 (with normal zoning rules reinstated in 2021/2022)  
  Rescinded By: The resolution was tied to the local emergency; as conditions improved and regular permitting resumed, its provisions were phased out  
  Summary:  
   – In order to help restaurants survive while indoor dining was restricted, the City Council adopted a resolution to waive certain zoning requirements and permit fees for temporary outdoor dining setups.  
   – This allowed restaurants to quickly expand their seating outdoors on sidewalks, parking lots, or other available spaces, ensuring continued operation with proper safety measures.  
   – For Q3 2020 businesses, particularly restaurants, this measure provided a vital opportunity to generate revenue when indoor operations were still curtailed by strict health orders.
   – It also demonstrated Camarillo’s willingness to adapt its regulatory framework to support local business survival during the pandemic.
   – By mitigating some of the capacity losses inherent in indoor-only operations, the resolution helped soften the economic impact of restrictions imposed in Q3 2020.

• Miscellaneous City Measures  
  Dates: Various times throughout 2020 (spring and summer)  
  Summary:  
   – Beyond explicit orders, Camarillo implemented several supportive actions.  
   – These included suspending late fees on business taxes, moving permit processes online (especially for construction projects), and promoting take-out dining campaigns to support local restaurants.
   – Code enforcement worked in tandem with Ventura County to ensure businesses adhered to health guidelines.
   – Such measures were designed to mitigate the economic shock of the shutdowns and provide regulatory relief where possible.
   – They also helped businesses adapt to the “new normal” – a landscape marked by persistent social distancing and operational modifications.

Overall Analysis of Q3 2020 Impact on Businesses in Camarillo
─────────────────────────────

Across all governmental levels, the orders and regulations imposed a layered mix of shutdowns, partial reopenings, and rapid reversals that created an exceptionally challenging environment for businesses. For a typical Camarillo business in Q3 2020:
  – The legacy of the March and April stay-at-home orders meant that even as reopening was attempted in May and early summer, many sectors had only limited operating capacities.
  – The July 13 statewide rollback forced many establishments to again cease indoor operations, severely limiting revenue, especially for sectors like restaurants, gyms, and salons.
  – Both state and local eviction moratoriums provided temporary protections but did not resolve the underlying financial strain.
  – The gradual and highly regionally variable tier system (Blueprint) meant that operational uncertainty was a constant, making it difficult to plan for long-term staffing and investments.
  – The cumulative effect was a “roller-coaster” of operational restrictions and relief measures that forced businesses to continuously adapt and contributed to economic stress during Q3 2020.
