COVID-19 Orders Business Impact  
──────────────────────────────

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, California state, Ventura County, and City of Camarillo orders and proclamations, along with a narrative summary. (Embedded sources are referenced in the text as, for example, “【43†L106-L115】” and the associated hyperlinks are preserved.)

──────────────────────────────
1. Federal Orders
──────────────────────────────

A. Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”  
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (it continued to be in effect during the period; later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
 • Rescission Details: Later formally ended long after the period in question  
 • Summary: On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a national emergency due to COVID‑19. Although this proclamation did not itself mandate business closures, it activated federal emergency powers and enabled subsequent state and local restrictions. Its presence established the framework that supported other, more targeted orders. In Q3 2020, while the national emergency itself did not close businesses, its continuation underpinned state and county orders that limited operations. (Source: “Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency…” – https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020…” 【43†L106-L115】)

B. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel  
 • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (with an effective CDC order on February 1, 2021)  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (remained in force throughout the period; ultimately ended by a court order on April 18, 2022)  
 • Summary: Under a new executive directive of the Biden administration, mask wearing was required on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal facilities. Although these measures were directed primarily at travel and federal operations rather than private business operations, they reflected the federal government’s overall approach to address the pandemic. For businesses in Camarillo this was less directly impactful in Q3 2020 since these mandates were introduced in early 2021; nevertheless, they signaled the ongoing federal concern over COVID‑19 that influenced state and local policy.

2. California State Orders
──────────────────────────────

A. State of Emergency Proclamation (Governor Newsom’s Declaration)  
 • Order Name: California COVID-19 State of Emergency (Governor’s Proclamation; not given a number)  
 • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not during 2020–2021 (remained in force over that period)  
 • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency to prepare the state’s public health system, mobilize resources, and authorize emergency actions. This proclamation provided the legal basis for subsequent public health orders, including business restrictions and temporary relief measures. In Q3 2020, although the emergency declaration itself was not a shutdown order, it reinforced the legal authority for orders that limited capacity and imposed restrictions on operating conditions for businesses. (Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/ …; source reference: 【45†L72-L80】)

B. Executive Order N-33-20 – “Stay-at-Home” Order  
 • Order Number: EO N-33-20  
 • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded via Executive Order N-07-21 on June 11, 2021, with full effect on June 15, 2021)  
 • Summary: EO N-33-20 was a statewide lockdown order instructing all Californians to remain at home except for essential activities. It forced “non‑essential” businesses to shut down or operate in a limited capacity (often only for take‑out, curbside pickup, or minimal operations). Although by Q3 2020 some gradual reopening had taken place, many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints derived from this initial shutdown order. The order’s legacy was visible in restrictions including reduced capacity and reopening limitations that directly affected revenue during the troubled summer months.

C. State Public Health Officer Orders and Reopening Transitions  
 i. Stage 2 “Safely Reopening” Order (May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020)  
  • Enacted: May 7, 2020; amended May 20, 2020  
  • Rescinded: Superseded later by the “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” order beginning August 31, 2020 and ultimately terminated by the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint order  
  • Summary: With a slight flattening of cases in May 2020, California initiated Stage 2 of its reopening. This order allowed lower‑risk businesses—especially retail (with curbside pickup)—to reopen under strict health and safety protocols. In Camarillo, this meant that some operations (for example, dine‑in restaurants at reduced capacity and select retail services) were able to resume. However, these reopenings came with the caveat that if COVID‑19 cases surged again (as happened in July 2020), restrictions would be re‑imposed, leading to the volatile business environment experienced in Q3 2020. (Links: Various orders and state guidance; source reference: 【18†L39-L47】, 【29†L437-L445】)

 ii. July 13, 2020 State Public Health Officer Order (Rollback of Reopening)  
  • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 as the framework transitioned to the “Blueprint” tier system and later formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
  • Summary: As summer 2020 brought a steep rise in COVID‑19 cases, the state re‑imposed closures on previously reopened sectors. Many indoor operations – including restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters, and personal care services – were ordered closed or limited strictly to outdoor or take‑out services. For Camarillo businesses, this abrupt rollback in July 2020 meant that establishments which had reopened in late spring were forced to reduce operations once more during Q3 2020. The measure was intended to curb increasing transmission rates, but it also led to economic distress in the local business community. (Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp‑content/uploads/2020/ …; source reference: 【18†L49-L57】)

 iii. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” – Color‑Tier Reopening System (Effective August 28/31, 2020)  
  • Order Date/Number: Announced August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020  
  • Rescinded: Terminated on June 15, 2021 with the “Beyond Blueprint” order  
  • Summary: Instead of blunt “on/off” orders, California instituted a graduated, risk‑based tier system that assigned every county a color (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID‑19 metrics. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, initially entered the most restrictive “Purple” tier on August 31, 2020, meaning most indoor operations remained closed or operated at very limited capacity. Although the system allowed for incremental easing later if conditions improved, in Q3 2020 most Camarillo businesses still faced very strict limitations on indoor operations.

 iv. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order (June 11, 2021)  
  • Enacted: June 11, 2021 (with full effect June 15, 2021)  
  • Summary: This order formally terminated the previous stay‑at‑home orders and retired the Blueprint tier system, paving the way for full reopening of businesses. While it served as the endpoint for the extended period of COVID‑related restrictions, its issuance highlights how long the strict controls—directly affecting business operations—remained in place. The fact that complete reopening did not occur until mid‑2021 emphasizes the unfolding economic squeeze during Q3 2020. (Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp‑content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21‐EO‑N‐07‑21‐signed.pdf#:~:text=1)%20Executive%20Order%20N‑33‑20… 【20†L63-L70】)

──────────────────────────────
3. Ventura County Orders
──────────────────────────────

A. Ventura County Local Health Emergency Declaration  
 • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
 • Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended in 2022, beyond scope)  
 • Summary: Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. This declaration enabled the county to issue subsequent public health directives with the necessary legal authority. Although the emergency declaration did not in itself mandate specific business restrictions, it provided the basis for later orders such as the “Stay Well at Home” directive and other local measures that directly affected businesses in Camarillo. Its continuation throughout 2020 justified a coordinated county‑level response to consecutive COVID‑19 outbreaks. (Link: See Ventura County official documents)

B. “Stay Well at Home” Order (March 20, 2020)  
 • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
 • Rescinded: Officially ended on June 11, 2021 when local restrictions were lifted in line with state reopening  
 • Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities and mandated the closure of non‑essential businesses. It directly imposed limitations on in‑person operations for most businesses in the county – including those in Camarillo. Although later modified to allow for partial reopenings, many restrictions stemming from this order (such as capacity limitations and operating only on an “essential” basis) continued to affect Q3 2020 businesses. The rationale was to mitigate rising case counts and ease the burden on local health care systems in the face of the pandemic surge. (Link: See order PDF files such as from https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/…)

C. Order Updates and Reopening Transitions in Ventura County  
 i. Order Extensions and Social Distancing (March–April 2020)  
  • Key Dates: March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
  • Rescinded: Replaced by a May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order aligning with state guidance  
  • Summary: As COVID‑19 case numbers rose in early 2020, Ventura County updated its stay‑home order several times. These updates extended the duration and added specific social distancing measures such as a complete ban on gatherings outside a single household and requirements for safety protocols at essential businesses. Although these specific provisions were eventually superseded by a coordinated reopening plan, they set the standards that many businesses in Camarillo had to follow even as operations slowly resumed in Q3 2020. (Links: e.g. order details linked on county website)

 ii. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order (May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 Amendment)  
  • Enacted: May 7, 2020, with amendments on May 20, 2020  
  • Rescinded: Superseded by the Blueprint order on August 31, 2020  
  • Summary: These orders allowed for the gradual reopening of lower‑risk sectors in Ventura County. In Camarillo, this meant that certain retail and manufacturing operations reopened (often with curbside or take‑out services), yet many high‑risk sectors remained closed. The mixed reopening environment contributed to later volatility during Q3 2020, when a surge in cases forced another rollback of indoor operations later in the summer. (Link: See county “Reopening” documentation such as https://vcportal.ventura.org/…)

D. Local Reimplementation of Rollback Measures (July 13, 2020 Order)  
 • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
 • Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county transitioned to the tiered system  
 • Summary: In response to a sharp COVID‑19 surge, Ventura County issued an order on July 13, 2020 consistent with the state's rollback. This order mandated the closure of many indoor sectors – including gyms, personal care services, and other high‑risk activities – in the county. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that many establishments that had experienced some reopening in late spring were forced back into shutdown conditions during the summer, leading to financial stress through Q3 2020. (Link: Refer to county PDF orders; source reference 【9†L31‑L39】)

E. Ventura County Reopening Transition: “Red Tier” Order (October 6, 2020)  
 • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
 • Rescinded: Later affected by December 2020 and January 2021 orders; eventually state orders ended in June 2021  
 • Summary: With improving COVID‑19 metrics, Ventura County moved from the Purple tier into the less‑restrictive Red tier. The October 6 order allowed indoor operations of certain sectors (gyms, personal care, places of worship) to resume under strict guidelines. Although this easing came at the very end of Q3 2020 (or slightly afterward), it stemmed directly from the strict measures imposed during the summer surge and illustrated the cyclical nature of restrictions in response to changing case numbers. (Link: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf)

F. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order (December 3, 2020)  
 • Order Date: Announced December 3, 2020 (effective December 6, 2020)  
 • Rescinded: Lifted on January 25, 2021  
 • Summary: Although originating in Q4 2020 (and thus not directly covering Q3 2020), this order is mentioned as it underscored the threat in the broader region. Tied to ICU capacity requirements, it mandated a full shutdown of many business sectors if regional hospital capacity fell below critical thresholds. In Q3 2020, even before this later order was implemented, businesses were already operating under the hazard of another potential lockdown. (Link: Refer to regional orders on county or local news sites; source reference 【59†L55-L63】)

4. City of Camarillo Orders
──────────────────────────────

A. Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation  
 • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
 • Rescinded: Not during the 2020–2021 period (formally ended in 2022)  
 • Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency to address COVID‑19. This declaration activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed prompt measures such as facility closures and cancellations of public events. For local businesses, while it did not directly close commercial operations, it signaled that the city was coordinating with county and state obligations—which later translated into restrictions and relief measures affecting business operations during Q3 2020. (Link: Refer to Camarillo official websites; source reference 【38†L29-L37】)

B. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders  
 • Order Numbers: Initially EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (March 18, 2020) and amended on April 23, 2020  
 • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
 • Rescinded: For residential aspects, superseded by California’s COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on August 31, 2020; city provisions eventually ended when the overall emergency was lifted  
 • Summary: The City of Camarillo implemented a local moratorium to protect tenants—both residential and commercial—from eviction due to COVID‑19–related financial hardships. This measure prevented landlords from initiating eviction proceedings during the worst periods of revenue loss. In Q3 2020, this protective order provided some stability to local business tenants. Although it did not forgive rent, the delay helped many small businesses remain in their leased premises during severely curtailed operations. (Link: e.g., details at Camarillo’s official municipal pages, with inline citations 【35†L218-L222】)

C. Camarillo Temporary Outdoor Dining Program – Resolution No. 2020‑63  
 • Order/Resolution Number: 2020‑63  
 • Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately, as adopted in early June 2020)  
 • Rescinded: Expired when COVID‑19 capacity restrictions ended (effectively June 15, 2021, with full indoor dining resumption)  
 • Summary: In an effort to ease the economic blow on restaurants unable to serve customers indoors under the prevailing restrictions, the Camarillo City Council passed Resolution 2020‑63. This resolution waived standard zoning requirements and permit fees to allow temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. As a result, many local restaurants could continue to serve customers outdoors during Q3 2020, thereby mitigating some revenue losses even as indoor dining remained banned or severely limited. (Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020… 【38†L2-L8】)

D. Miscellaneous City Measures  
 • Dates: Various dates during spring–summer 2020  
 • Summary: In addition to the above orders, Camarillo adopted several supportive measures to sustain local businesses. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online, and launching promotional campaigns to boost take‑out and outdoor dining. While these actions were not “orders” in the strict regulatory sense, they formed part of the city’s overall COVID‑19 response that helped local businesses adjust to unprecedented operating conditions in Q3 2020.

Overall Analysis of Q3 2020 Impact on Camarillo Businesses
──────────────────────────────

Across all levels—from federal emergency declarations that set the tone for our response to the detailed state, county, and city orders—businesses in Camarillo faced an extremely challenging environment in the third quarter of 2020. Many businesses were forced to repeatedly open and then scale back or close entirely in response to volatile changes in local COVID‑19 metrics. For instance, initial reopenings in May were frustrated by a summer surge that prompted a rollback, leaving many establishments (such as restaurants, gyms, and personal care services) to operate at drastically reduced capacity or exclusively outdoors. Additionally, supportive measures such as eviction moratoria and a temporary outdoor dining program helped offset the economic damage but could not fully overcome the adverse effects of widespread restrictions. The cyclical nature of these measures—driven by steep rises and falls in case numbers—explains why Q3 2020 was a uniquely disruptive period for Camarillo’s economic landscape.
