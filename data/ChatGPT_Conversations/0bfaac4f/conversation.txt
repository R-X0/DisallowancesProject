# COVID‑19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## Federal Orders

• **Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”**  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
  – Rescinded By: A later congressional action (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  – Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding that indirectly enabled—and justified—subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. Although the proclamation did not itself mandate business closures, its formal declaration established a framework under which later measures operated. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still affected by the persistent national emergency, meaning federal support (such as stimulus aid) was available even as state and local restrictions — imposed under the authority granted by this proclamation — continued to limit operations. The ongoing emergency declaration underscored the severity of the pandemic, contributing to the continuation of strict measures at lower levels of government.

• **CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”**  
  – Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (with Executive Order 13998 and a CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (remained in force throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  – Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate  
  – Summary: Although these mandates were not directly targeting business operations, they imposed mask‑wearing requirements on interstate travel modes such as airplanes, trains, buses, and in airports and federal properties. These federal directives reflected a continued emphasis on public health and safe operations in transit environments. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 the direct impact was minimal since the mandates took effect in 2021; however, they exemplify the overall federal response as the administration shifted toward safe operation protocols rather than full shutdowns. This federal action further illustrates how the pandemic was managed through evolving measures at different levels, even if the Q3 2020 business environment was driven more by state and local orders.

*Federal Note:* The primary restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal declarations provided an overarching emergency context, empowering state and local authorities. In Q3 2020, there was no nationwide lockdown on private businesses; instead, California’s orders (supported by the national emergency) governed operations.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## California State Orders

• **State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”**  
  – Order Number: (No specific order number; this was the Governor’s Proclamation)  
  – Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained in effect throughout)  
  – Rescinded By: Ended on February 28, 2023 by a later proclamation  
  – Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California on March 4, 2020 in response to the pandemic. This declaration empowered state agencies to take extraordinary measures, such as suspending certain laws and mobilizing resources. Throughout Q3 2020, the ongoing state emergency justified and underpinned stringent public health orders that continued to affect business operations. The emergency status meant measures such as capacity limits, social distancing protocols, and phased reopenings were legally supported. Businesses had to adapt to frequently changing directives meant to protect public health during ongoing crisis conditions.

• **Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”**  
  – Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately upon issuance)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) terminated the statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order, as well as by later phased reopening orders  
  – Summary: This sweeping lockdown order mandated that all California residents stay at home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors. It forced non‑essential businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) either to close or work only at minimal capacity while permitting only essential businesses to operate. Although by the summer some sectors had begun to reopen, many Q3 2020 operations were still limited due to lingering effects or modifications of this order. The continued “until further notice” language meant that even as some reopening occurred, businesses operated in a restricted environment, with indoor operations often still curtailed. The original shutdown and its successors are a key reason why many Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 were either closed or severely limited.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”**  
  – Order Date: May 7, 2020 (issued as part of Executive Order N‑60‑20)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: Superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order on June 11, 2021 which formally ended earlier restrictions  
  – Summary: As case rates in California began to plateau in the spring, the State Public Health Officer issued an order on May 7, 2020 to begin “Stage 2” of reopening. This order allowed lower‑risk businesses such as curbside retail (e.g., clothing stores, bookstores, florists) to resume operations while essential high‑risk sectors (like dine‑in restaurants, gyms, salons) remained closed. For Camarillo, this order marked the beginning of cautious reopening in Q3 2020 – businesses could resume limited operations but with strict health protocols required. However, because COVID‑19 cases surged again during the summer of 2020, many initial reopenings were soon reversed, leaving Q3 businesses with an uncertain and rapidly shifting regulatory landscape.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”**  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: The new “Blueprint” Order, and later by the June 15, 2021 order  
  – Summary: In response to a sharp increase in COVID cases in July 2020, California re‑imposed lockdown measures that mandated the closure of many indoor operations which had been allowed under Stage 2. This order required indoor dining to shut down (allowing only outdoor dining and take‑out), closed bars, movie theaters, and non‑essential indoor venues. In Q3 2020, businesses that had reopened in May or June were forced to scale back or close again in July. This rollback was a direct response to the summer surge and is a primary reason many Camarillo businesses experienced a severe downturn in Q3.

• **“Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color‑Tier Reopening System”**  
  – Order Number: (State Public Health Officer Order issued on August 28, 2020)  
  – Date Enacted: Announced August 28, 2020 and effective August 31, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021  
  – Summary: The Blueprint for a Safer Economy introduced a color‑coded, risk‑based tier system for reopening business operations gradually. Under this framework, each county (including Ventura County, encompassing Camarillo) was assigned a tier—from Purple (most restrictive) to Yellow (least restrictive)—based on local COVID‑19 metrics. In Q3 2020, Ventura County was largely in the Purple tier, which meant that many indoor business operations remained restricted; for example, retail stores could open only at limited capacity and restaurants generally operated only via take‑out and outdoor dining. The system was designed to adjust restrictions based on current data and explains the continuously challenging operating conditions for local businesses in Q3 2020. As the county began to trend toward the Red tier in October 2020, some restrictions eased; however, for most of Q3, heavy restrictions remained.

• **Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”**  
  – Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in the region on December 6, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ decision to lift the order once ICU projections improved  
  – Summary: In late 2020, in response to a severe winter surge and dropping ICU capacity in Southern California, California issued a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order that mandated a return to near‑complete shutdown if ICU availability dropped below 15%. Although this order came into effect in December 2020 and primarily governed Q4 2020/early Q1 2021, its existence underscored the precarious operating environment businesses had experienced throughout 2020. For Camarillo, even though Q3 2020 was not directly under this order, the looming threat of emergency measures such as this created uncertainty and contributed to cautious business practices during the third quarter.

• **“Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – (Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order)**  
  – Order Date: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order ended prior restrictions)  
  – Rescinded By: This order itself formally rescinded and terminated prior pandemic business restrictions  
  – Summary: This pair of orders marked the full reopening of California as they terminated the original Stay‑at‑Home mandate and the Blueprint tier system. While highly significant from a historical perspective, in Q3 2020 this order was not yet in force. Its eventual issuance in June 2021 highlights how long the restrictions had affected businesses — with Q3 2020 being a period where operations were still under severe constraints, only to see full reopening several quarters later when public health metrics improved.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## Ventura County Orders

• **Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”**  
  – Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active; ended in 2022)  
  – Rescinded By: A resolution by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 2022  
  – Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency. Although the declaration did not in itself impose restrictions, it provided the legal authority for the county to issue subsequent public health orders. The continued emergency status throughout 2020 ensured that any local health measures could be swiftly implemented and enforced. In Q3 2020, this standing emergency allowed the county to maintain or update restrictions that directly impacted businesses in Camarillo.

• **Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”**  
  – Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s order of March 20, 2020  
  – Summary: Before the statewide stay‑at‑home order, Ventura County independently issued an order on March 17, 2020 directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordering early closures of bars, nightclubs, gyms, and similar venues. Although soon incorporated into a broader county stay‑home directive, this early order set a proactive tone for the county’s rapid and strict response. The legacy of these measures influenced local business practices into the summer of 2020 and laid the groundwork for the continued restrictions seen in Q3.

• **“Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay‑Home Order”**  
  – Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (formally lifted by the Ventura County Health Officer’s update on June 15, 2021)  
  – Rescinded By: The June 15, 2021 order ending local restrictions  
  – Summary: Ventura County’s Stay Well at Home Order required all residents to remain at their place of residence except for essential activities. It closed all non‑essential businesses, meaning that almost every Camarillo business was forced to suspend in‑person operations unless classified as essential. Although later modified for partial reopening, many of the core restrictions continued to affect Q3 2020 operations. The order remained in force — in revised forms — throughout 2020, leading to ongoing limitations in business capacity, reduced operating hours, and strict compliance with health protocols.

• **Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”**  
  – Order Dates:  
  ◦ March 31, 2020 (extension through April 19, 2020)  
  ◦ April 9, 2020 (added gathering bans and safety protocols)  
  ◦ April 20, 2020 (further extension through May 15, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded in May 2020 by a “Safely Reopening” order aligning with state regulations  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 order replacing earlier versions  
  – Summary: In response to evolving conditions, Ventura County updated its stay‑home order several times in March and April 2020. These updates extended the order’s duration and tightened restrictions by banning gatherings and requiring social distancing measures at essential businesses. Although these specific orders were replaced as reopening progressed, their requirements for distancing, mask‑use, and capacity limits became standard practice even into Q3 2020. They were instrumental in establishing the safety protocols that businesses had to adhere to upon reopening later in the year.

• **“Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”**  
  – Order Dates:  
  ◦ May 7, 2020 – “Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” order  
  ◦ May 20, 2020 – Amendment allowing dine‑in and in‑store retail with precautions  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint on August 31, 2020 and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening order  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of August 31, 2020 (and ultimately the state order in June 2021)  
  – Summary: As conditions improved in May 2020, Ventura County introduced a set of orders to cautiously begin reopening. The May 7 order lifted many of the harsher April restrictions and allowed lower‑risk businesses (like curbside retail and manufacturing supporting those retailers) to restart operations. An amendment on May 20 further allowed dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail to reopen under strict safety protocols. For Camarillo businesses, these orders meant that by early summer, some operations restarted albeit under a cautious and highly regulated framework. However, the subsequent summer surge forced many businesses to face renewed closures in July, illustrating the volatile environment of Q3 2020.

• **Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”**  
  – Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for closure during July 3–5, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Automatically expired after July 5, 2020  
  – Rescinded By: The order expired at the end of the designated holiday weekend  
  – Summary: Anticipating that the popular Independence Day weekend could lead to large gatherings amid rising COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County ordered its beaches closed and parking lots off‑limits for that period. This temporary measure curtailed tourism and other beach‑related commerce, affecting businesses in and around the coastal region. Although Camarillo is inland, local tourism and regional economic activity were impacted as fewer visitors traveled to the nearby coast during the holiday. This order highlights the willingness of local health officials to enact targeted, time‑limited closures to mitigate potential “super‑spreader” events during the volatile Q3 period.

• **Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”**  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded October 6, 2020 as the county moved to a lower tier  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s October 6, 2020 order, which allowed certain indoor operations to resume  
  – Summary: In alignment with the statewide rollback on July 13, 2020, Ventura County issued a local order mandating the closure of indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, personal care services (e.g., nail salons, tattoo parlors) and places of worship. This order ensured strict local compliance with the state’s renewed restrictions. As a result, many Camarillo businesses that had briefly reopened in early summer were forced to close their indoor facilities again in July. The order's later partial rescission in October signaled the beginning of easing, but its July–September period was a major contributor to the business downturn in Q3 2020.

• **Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”**  
  – Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Although conditions later led to further changes in December 2020 and January 2021, this order itself was effectively superseded by subsequent regional orders and the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening  
  – Rescinded By: The December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and subsequent orders, finally terminated by the June 15, 2021 state order  
  – Summary: By early October 2020, improved metrics allowed Ventura County’s status to shift from the Purple tier to the less restrictive Red tier. The October order rescinded portions of the July 13 restrictions, thereby permitting indoor operations for gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services—with strict capacity and safety guidelines. Although this easing came at the very end of Q3 or in the fall transition, it offered a glimpse of recovery for affected sectors. For Camarillo businesses that had endured nearly three months of harsh restrictions, the impending red‑tier status was a critical relief, even though full normality would not arrive until the later reopening.

• **Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”**  
  – Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  – Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, protections extended through September 30, 2020 (others later replaced by state law for residential evictions effective September 1, 2020 via AB 3088)  
  – Rescinded By: California’s COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential cases and local resolution for commercial cases  
  – Summary: In response to the financial hardships imposed by the pandemic, Ventura County implemented an eviction moratorium protecting residential and commercial tenants from eviction due to non‑payment of rent. Initially set for a brief period and then extended, this measure provided critical relief for small local businesses struggling with reduced income in Q2 and Q3 2020. For a Camarillo business, this meant that even if they were unable to pay rent on time due to pandemic disruptions, they were not at immediate risk of eviction. Although only a deferral (and not a forgiveness of rent), the moratorium allowed many businesses to remain in place during one of the most challenging periods of the pandemic.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## City of Camarillo Orders

• **Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”**  
  – Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect into 2021; formally ended in 2022)  
  – Rescinded By: A later Camarillo City Council resolution ending the COVID emergency (in April 2022)  
  – Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID‑19. This declaration activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed rapid deployment of city resources and measures. It led to the closing of city facilities and cancellation of public events, which in turn influenced local business operations—in some cases by limiting access to municipal services or communal events that supported business activity. In Q3 2020, the city’s emergency status still underscored the seriousness of the crisis and enabled authorities to enforce additional measures (for example, outdoor dining provisions) that directly affected business functioning.

• **Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”**  
  – Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (issued March 18, 2020) with an amendment on April 23, 2020  
  – Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, later superseded by state law on August 31, 2020; commercial protections expired when the local emergency ended  
  – Rescinded By: California AB 3088 for residential cases; Camarillo’s local emergency termination for remaining provisions  
  – Summary: To protect local tenants and business owners from the financial devastation wrought by the pandemic, Camarillo enacted its own eviction moratorium in March 2020. This order prohibited landlords from evicting residential and commercial tenants who were financially impaired by COVID‑19. It provided local protections parallel to county and state measures and helped many small businesses avoid the immediate threat of losing their premises during a period of severe revenue loss in Q3 2020. While it did not cancel rent obligations, it deferred them long enough to give businesses an opportunity to adapt and survive during the most disruptive months.

• **Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”**  
  – Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Expired when COVID‑19 capacity restrictions ended (roughly June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed)
  – Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated  
  – Summary: Recognizing that indoor dining had been largely curtailed by state and county orders, the City of Camarillo adopted Resolution 2020‑63 to facilitate outdoor dining for local restaurants. The resolution waived certain zoning requirements and fees, allowing eateries to quickly establish temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo restaurants depended on these outdoor arrangements to continue serving customers when indoor dining was either banned or severely capacity‑restricted. This measure not only provided an economic lifeline but also demonstrated the city’s attempt to balance public health concerns with business survival. Its temporary nature meant that when full reopening finally occurred in 2021, the outdoor measures were phased out.

• **Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”**  
  – Dates: Various throughout spring and summer 2020  
  – Summary: In addition to the major orders above, the City of Camarillo took several supportive measures to ease the impact on local businesses. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online, and promoting take‑out dining campaigns. These actions, while not formal “orders,” contributed to the overall regulatory and economic landscape that Camarillo businesses had to navigate during Q3 2020.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
General Overview of Q3 2020 Impact

Taken together, the federal, state, county, and city orders created a layered response meant to balance public health and economic survival. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses faced a patchwork of quarantines, capacity restrictions, sudden rollbacks (such as the July closures), and uncertain reopening plans. This regulatory environment meant that even when some businesses reopened partially (often with outdoor or limited‑capacity indoor service), they continued to operate under rapid shifts in guidelines and the constant threat of a resurgence. The cumulative effect was significant economic disruption and operational uncertainty during that quarter.
