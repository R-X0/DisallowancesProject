RE: Formal Protest to Letter [Insert Letter Number] – ERC Disallowance for Q3  
Tax Period: 3rd Quarter 2020 (202007–202009)  
Claim Amount: $[Insert Amount]  

Dear Appeals Officer,

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing 4534’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for the third quarter of 2020. The disallowance was based on the assertion that no government orders were in effect during Q3 2020 that caused a suspension or partial suspension of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Multiple federal, state, county, and city government orders were active during Q3 2020, imposing COVID‑19–related restrictions that significantly affected our business activities. In this letter, we provide a detailed timeline of the relevant government orders, explain their specific impact on our operations during Q3 2020, and cite applicable IRS guidance demonstrating that 4534 qualifies for the ERC under the “partial suspension” provisions.

• Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
• Order Summary: This federal proclamation declared a nationwide emergency in response to COVID‑19, thereby activating federal emergency powers and providing the legal basis for subsequent state and local health directives.

• Date Rescinded: Still in effect

It provided the foundational legal authority for the subsequent orders affecting non‑essential businesses.  
• Impact on Quarter: In Q3 2020, operating under this state of emergency meant that our business was subject to evolving health protocols, limited operating capacities, and other restrictions that disrupted normal operations.

Summary and Request

The government orders detailed above collectively demonstrate that, contrary to the IRS’s assertion, numerous COVID‑19–related directives were in place during Q3 2020. These orders imposed mandatory restrictions that partially suspended the normal operations of our business. The limitations on in‑person operations, capacity constraints, and required safety protocols had a material, more than nominal, effect on our ability to conduct business as usual.

In light of these facts, we respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our ERC for the third quarter of 2020. The credit we claimed is in full compliance with IRS guidance regarding the partial suspension of operations caused by COVID‑19 government orders. We have enclosed copies of the relevant government orders and supporting documentation outlining the impact these orders had on our operations.

Attestation: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I submitted the protest and accompanying documents, and to the best of my personal knowledge and belief, the information stated in the protest and accompanying documents is true, correct, and complete.”

Sincerely,

[Authorized Representative Name]
