COVID‑19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not officially rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023, which is beyond the scope here)  
  – Rescinded By: A later congressional action (after our timeframe)  
  – Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency in response to COVID‑19. It activated a wide range of federal emergency powers and funding to support continued response measures. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it created a legal and administrative context that empowered state and local authorities to issue strict public health orders. In Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo continued to operate under ongoing federal emergency conditions—meaning while federal measures provided support (e.g., stimulus aid), the actual restrictions on daily business operations were largely determined by state and local orders.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel  
  – Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (with an executive order and a CDC mandate beginning February 1, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not during 2020–2021 (in effect through 2021; officially lifted by a court order in April 2022)  
  – Rescinded By: A court order in April 2022 (after our period)  
  – Summary: With the change in federal leadership during early 2021, new federal mask‑wearing requirements were imposed on travel. This policy mandated masks on airplanes, in airports, on trains, buses, and federal properties. Although these measures were directed at travel and federal operations rather than directly targeting local businesses, they illustrate the continuing federal response to the pandemic. For Q3 2020, these mandates had no direct effect on Camarillo businesses but serve as an additional layer of context for evolving federal public health responses as the pandemic progressed.

────────────────────────────────────────
2. California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency  
  – Order Number: Not applicable (a Governor’s proclamation)  
  – Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout)  
  – Rescinded By: Ended in February 2023 by the Governor (beyond our timeframe)  
  – Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in early March 2020, authorizing unprecedented actions and resource mobilization across state agencies. The proclamation laid the groundwork that enabled later mandatory lockdowns and restrictions on business operations. In Q3 2020, the continued state of emergency meant that public health directives (even if modified) were fully supported by emergency powers. This legal framework justified keeping many restrictions on businesses in place in an effort to slow the virus spread.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
  – Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) which terminated the previous stay‑at‑home directive  
  – Summary: This order mandated that all individuals in California remain at home except for essential needs. It resulted in the closure or drastic limitation of “non‑essential” businesses such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, and theaters. Although by Q3 2020 some reopening had begun (with modifications and capacity limits), the original shutdown’s spirit and many of its restrictions still influenced operations. For Camarillo businesses, this very order—and its subsequent modifications—meant that any reopening during the summer was partial and subject to sudden changes should case numbers rise again.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)  
  – Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued as part of EO N‑60‑20)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
  – Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
  – Summary: With a slight plateau in case rates, California moved into a Stage 2 reopening phase on May 7, 2020. This order relaxed the stay‑home requirements for lower‑risk businesses—allowing retail stores (with curbside pickup), supply chain activities, and other lower‑risk operations to resume. However, higher‑risk venues such as dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons remained closed at that time. For Q3 2020, although many businesses in Camarillo had initially reopened under these rules, the summer surge in cases forced further rollbacks, demonstrating the instability of the reopening process.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded By: The subsequent State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 “Beyond Blueprint” Reopening Order  
  – Summary: In response to a significant surge in COVID‑19 cases during the summer, California ordered a rollback on many reopenings. This move forced indoor closures for numerous sectors—restaurants were limited to outdoor or takeout operations; gyms, theaters, and bars were closed; and other indoor venues faced restrictions. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses that had experienced a brief reopening in May/June were forced to curtail operations again in July. The rollback underscored the unpredictable and volatile nature of the pandemic during that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System  
  – Order Number: (Issued as a State Public Health Officer Order on August 28, 2020, effective August 31, 2020)  
  – Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (framework effective August 31, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
  – Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)  
  – Summary: The Blueprint for a Safer Economy replaced the previous blanket closures with a graduated, color‑coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID‑19 metrics. Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning indoor operations for many businesses were still not permitted. The framework allowed reopening only on a measured basis and automatically imposed new restrictions if local metrics worsened. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that even as some restrictions were lifted compared to July, many still faced severe limits on indoor capacity throughout Q3 2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Earlier Restrictions  
  – Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order  
  – Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order ended all remaining COVID‑related business restrictions)  
  – Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded the previous orders  
  – Summary: Issued as the pandemic situation improved and vaccination rates increased, this order formally terminated the statewide stay‑at‑home order and the Blueprint tier system. It lifted capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other operational restrictions on businesses. While not directly affecting Q3 2020, its absence underscores how long the earlier restrictions (and their consequences for Q3 2020) persisted before full reopening.

3. Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
  – Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not during 2020–2021 (the local health emergency remained in effect; ended in 2022, beyond our scope)  
  – Rescinded By: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution (March 2022)  
  – Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency to address the outbreak. While the declaration itself did not mandate business closures, it provided legal authority for subsequent orders that directly affected business operations. In Q3 2020, the ongoing emergency status ensured that the county retained the ability to implement and enforce additional restrictions. This proactive stance underscored the county’s commitment to public health even as economic activities slowly resumed.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Early Closures and Gathering Restrictions  
  – Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order and later repealed by subsequent orders  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order on March 20, 2020  
  – Summary: Prior to statewide mandates, Ventura County issued an order on March 17, 2020 directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordering the closure of certain public venues and businesses. Although quickly replaced by a more comprehensive order on March 20, the March 17 directive set an early precedent for strict local action. Its spirit carried forward into Q3 2020 where local authorities continued to enforce cautionary measures.
  
• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)  
  – Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Formally lifted with local updates on June 11, 2021 (in alignment with state reopening)  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions  
  – Summary: This countywide order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs and work. As a result, nearly all in-person business operations were shut down unless classified as essential. By Q3 2020, even though some reopening had begun under modified guidelines, many of the original restrictions – such as capacity limits and operational protocols arising from the Stay Well at Home framework – were still influencing business operations in Camarillo.
  
• Ventura County Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  – Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Replaced on May 7, 2020 by a “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of May 7, 2020  
  – Summary: Between March and April 2020, Ventura County repeatedly updated its Stay Well at Home order to extend its duration and impose additional measures such as a ban on gatherings and required social distancing protocols. These orders forced businesses that remained open (such as essential retailers) to adopt strict safety measures that limited customer throughput and increased operating costs. Although these specific orders were replaced by more lenient reopening measures in May, their impact was long lasting—many of those safety protocols continued to be enforced in Q3 2020.
  
• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order (Stage 2 Reopening)  
  – Order Dates: May 7, 2020; Amended May 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint order (effective August 31, 2020) and ultimately ended with the June 15, 2021 state order  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of August 31, 2020 and later by the state’s reopening order  
  – Summary: In early May 2020, Ventura County shifted to a phased reopening strategy. The May 7 order allowed lower‑risk businesses (such as curbside retail and manufacturing supporting retail) to reopen, while the May 20 amendment further allowed dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail to operate under safety precautions. For Q3 2020, these orders meant that many Camarillo businesses were able to reopen at reduced capacity but continued to face uncertainty, as later surges in cases (in July) forced new closures.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order  
  – Order Date: Announced on June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5 holiday weekend  
  – Date Rescinded: Automatically expired July 6, 2020  
  – Rescinded By: Its own terms expired  
  – Summary: Anticipating gatherings during the Independence Day weekend and a surge in cases, Ventura County ordered beaches and adjacent parking areas to be closed for the holiday weekend. Although Camarillo is inland, many local businesses—especially those related to tourism or serving nearby coastal visitors—felt the impact when consumer traffic dropped during this period. This order illustrated the willingness of local authorities to impose targeted, short‑term restrictions to avoid “super‑spreader” events.

• Ventura County July 2020 Local Order – Implementation of State Rollback  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved into Tier 2  
  – Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  – Summary: In lockstep with Governor Newsom’s statewide July 13 order, Ventura County issued a local order that re‑closed indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and places of worship. This meant that many businesses in Camarillo—those operating fitness studios, salons, and similar venues—had to close or move operations outdoors. These closures contributed significantly to the economic hardships faced in Q3 2020.
  
• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order  
  – Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: The reopening was later affected by changes in December 2020 and January 2021  
  – Rescinded By: The December Regional Stay‑At‑Home Order and subsequent changes; fully nullified by the June 15, 2021 state order  
  – Summary: As public health metrics improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier in early October 2020. The October 6 order eased some restrictions and allowed indoor operations for previously shuttered sectors like gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services—albeit at limited capacity. Although this was a sign of progress, it came at the very end of Q3 2020 and was soon countered by renewed restrictions in December after a new surge in cases.
  
• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium  
  – Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  – Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, Ventura County’s protection lasted through September 30, 2020; residential protections were later taken over by state law (AB 3088) effective September 2020  
  – Rescinded By: State law for residential tenants (California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act, AB 3088) and by the county letting the commercial moratorium expire  
  – Summary: In recognition of the severe economic toll of COVID‑19, Ventura County enacted an eviction moratorium protecting both residential and commercial tenants from eviction due to nonpayment resulting from pandemic‑related hardships. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that small business tenants who lost revenue could delay rent payments without the immediate threat of losing their commercial space. Even though these measures were temporary deferrals and did not forgive rent, they provided critical relief during the challenging Q3 2020 period.

4. City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)  
  – Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: The Camarillo local emergency remained in effect throughout 2020–2021 and was later lifted in 2022  
  – Rescinded By: A City Council resolution ending the local COVID‑19 emergency (April 2022, beyond our timeframe)  
  – Summary: The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020 to activate its Emergency Operations Center and coordinate an effective local response. The declaration resulted in immediate closures of city facilities (such as City Hall, the public library, and community centers) and cancellations of public events. Although designed primarily for public safety and administrative response, the emergency status also had implications for businesses by signaling that strict local measures could be implemented at any time. In Q3 2020, this continuing state of emergency reinforced the overall regulatory environment in which Camarillo businesses operated.
  
• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders  
  – Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 issued March 18, 2020 and its Amendment on April 23, 2020  
  – Date Enacted: Initial order on March 18, 2020; amended on April 23, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the California Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential tenants on August 31, 2020; commercial aspects eventually ended when the local emergency concluded  
  – Rescinded By: State law for residential tenants and later City/County measures for commercial evictions  
  – Summary: Camarillo quickly acted to protect its residents and business tenants by issuing an eviction moratorium that paused evictions for those financially affected by the pandemic. This order ensured that local landlords could not force out tenants—even commercial ones—if they were unable to pay due to COVID‑19 impacts. For a small business operating in Camarillo during Q3 2020, such a moratorium provided crucial short‑term relief by preventing a sudden loss of commercial space during an already difficult economic period.
  
• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  – Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: The program expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (roughly when full indoor dining resumed on or after June 15, 2021)  
  – Rescinded By: Automatic sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning regulations were reinstated  
  – Summary: In order to help local restaurants remain operational while indoor dining was restricted, Camarillo’s City Council adopted Resolution No. 2020‑63. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to create temporary outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots, or other public spaces. For Q3 2020, this was a lifeline for restaurants forced to close indoor seating; by setting up approved outdoor dining areas, these businesses could continue serving customers safely. The policy was designed to mitigate the economic damage caused by lengthy shutdowns and provided a clear example of local-level adaptation to the pandemic challenges.

• Miscellaneous City Measures  
  – Dates: Various throughout spring and summer 2020  
  – Summary: In addition to the emergency proclamations and eviction moratoria, the City of Camarillo took several other steps to support local businesses. These included suspending late fees on business taxes, moving permitting processes online to reduce in‑person contact (thus facilitating continued construction and development), and promoting take‑out dining options to help restaurants generate revenue. While not all of these were “orders” in the regulatory sense, collectively they represent the city’s holistic approach to managing both public safety and economic stability during the pandemic.
