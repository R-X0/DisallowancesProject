Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect during that period; later terminated by Congress in 2023, which is beyond our timeframe)  
 • Rescinded By: A later congressional action (after our period)  
 • Summary: This presidential proclamation declared a national emergency in response to the COVID‑19 outbreak, thereby activating a wide range of federal emergency powers and access to funding. Although it did not by itself mandate the closure of businesses, it provided the legal basis and political impetus for state and local authorities to impose restrictions. In Q3 2020, even though businesses in Camarillo were primarily affected by state and local orders, this ongoing national emergency underscored the crisis’s severity and helped justify subsequent measures. Federal emergency status also supported economic relief programs that, indirectly, influenced how businesses could operate during the restrictions.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel  
 • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (via Executive Order 13998 and subsequent CDC directive effective February 1, 2021)  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (this mandate remained in place through 2021 and was later ended in 2022 via court ruling)  
 • Rescinded By: A court order in April 2022 (outside our timeframe)  
 • Summary: While not directly affecting local business operations, federal mask mandates for travel (covering airlines, interstate buses, trains, and airports) were part of the overall public health strategy. They represented a shift toward targeted interventions rather than blanket prohibitions on activities. For businesses in Q3 2020, which were subject to more severe state and county restrictions, the federal travel measures were less directly felt but symbolized the continuing and evolving federal response to the pandemic.

California State Orders

1. State of Emergency Proclamation (Governor’s Proclamation)  
 • Order Number: N/A (a Governor’s declaration)  
 • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: It remained active throughout 2020–2021 (rescinded in February 2023, beyond our scope)  
 • Rescinded By: Later proclamation in 2023  
 • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency as COVID‑19 cases began to rise, thereby authorizing a range of emergency actions and enabling subsequent health orders. This declaration allowed for regulatory relaxations and the rapid deployment of resources that set the stage for later business‐impacting shutdowns and reopenings. In Q3 2020, even though many specific restrictions had been modified, the underlying state emergency justified the continuation of various mandates. It also supported economic aid and other relief measures important for struggling businesses.

2. Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order  
 • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) which formally ended the statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order  
 • Summary: This was California’s all‑inclusive lockdown order that required residents to remain at home except for essential activities, forcing most non‑essential businesses to close or operate minimally. Its provisions drastically reduced business operations nationwide and, in Camarillo, meant that many establishments were either shut or offered very limited services. In Q3 2020, although phased reopenings had begun, many businesses were still operating under constraints (such as limited capacity and mandated outdoor only service) stemming from this original order and its subsequent modifications. The order remained “on the books” until improvement in public health metrics and vaccine progress allowed for a more thorough reopening.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening)  
 • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under EO N‑60‑20)  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: Superseded later by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order  
 • Summary: As California began easing the early lockdown, this order allowed lower‑risk businesses (such as curbside retail and manufacturing supply chains) to reopen under strict protocols. In Camarillo, the order meant that some businesses tentatively reopened in late spring and early summer, albeit with mandatory social distancing and altered service models. However, the easing was short‑lived as rising cases in Q3 forced additional rollbacks on indoor operations. The gradual, conditional reopening was a balancing act between economic recovery and public health concerns.
 • Link: (Refer to the official CDPH documents for details; e.g., see similar orders at https://www.cdph.ca.gov)

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Rollback of Reopening  
 • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the August 31, 2020 Blueprint tier framework; formally terminated on June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: The Blueprint Order (announced August 28, 2020) and later the Beyond Blueprint Order  
 • Summary: In response to a surge in COVID‑19 cases during the summer, California re‑imposed closures for many indoor operations (such as indoor dining, gyms, and personal care establishments) that had been previously reopened. For many Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May or early June, this meant a sudden and harsh rollback, forcing them into restricted service modes (e.g., takeout only for restaurants). The abrupt closure mid‑Q3 led to significant revenue losses and operational disruptions. The order reflected the state’s need to “hit the emergency brake” once case counts again rose sharply.
 • Link: (Refer to order details available in official state archives, e.g., similar information in https://www.gov.ca.gov)

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework  
 • Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
 • Date Enacted: Announced August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (with the issuance of the Beyond Blueprint Order)  
 • Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order  
 • Summary: This new, color‑coded tier system replaced the earlier “everything closed” approach with a risk‑based framework that dictated which sectors could operate and under what conditions. In Ventura County – which includes Camarillo – the county was initially placed in the Purple tier (the most restrictive) in early Q3 2020, meaning that many indoor business operations remained closed or operated at severely limited capacity. For businesses, the blueprint delivered a mix of cautious reopening (for curbside or outdoor services) and renewed restrictions if case metrics worsened. The framework was designed to bring predictability to reopening but meant that during Q3 many businesses continued to operate under heavy constraints.

6. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order  
 • Order Date: Announced December 3, 2020 (triggered December 6, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials once ICU projections improved  
 • Summary: As the COVID‑19 surge worsened toward the end of 2020, California implemented a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order for areas where hospital ICU capacity dipped below a critical threshold (15%). Although the order itself was a Q4 measure, its threat loomed over Q3 2020 as businesses had already been contending with intermittent closures and capacity reductions. The order forced even outdoor activities (such as restaurant patio dining) to face restrictions, highlighting the unstable and rapidly shifting environment. This served as a warning to businesses that reopening gains could quickly be reversed if case metrics worsened.

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
 • Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Health Officer Order  
 • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (with effectiveness starting June 15, 2021)  
 • Date Rescinded: Not applicable—it terminated the previous stay‑at‑home and tier‑based restrictions  
 • Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded earlier orders  
 • Summary: Marking a full reopening in California, this order officially ended the statewide stay‑at‑home mandate and the Blueprint tier system. Although its issuance came in June 2021, it underscores how long restrictions persisted; businesses in Q3 2020 were still operating under constrained conditions that would only be fully relaxed nearly a year later. It also reflects that, during Q3 2020, economic activity was still heavily disrupted due to the earlier orders.

Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
 • Order Date: March 12, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the county emergency remained in effect until 2022)  
 • Summary: The Ventura County Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020 to quickly mobilize county resources and authorize subsequent health orders. Although it did not directly close businesses, it provided the legal framework for mandatory shutdowns and restrictions later imposed. In Q3 2020, the continued existence of this emergency meant that local authorities retained broad powers to enforce health and safety measures affecting business operations.
 • Link: (Refer to official Ventura County documentation)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020)  
 • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded by a subsequent “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
 • Summary: This early order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered preliminary closures of certain businesses and public facilities even before the statewide mandate. In Q3 2020, while the March orders were no longer active, their aggressive tone set the expectation and framework for later, more prolonged restrictions.
 • Link: (Refer to official county public health orders)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)  
 • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in line with the state reopening)  
 • Summary: This order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs and forced the closure of nearly all non‑essential businesses. In Q3 2020, even though phased reopenings had begun, many business operations were still defined and limited by the remnants of this order—such as capacity restrictions and mandates for outdoor-only operations.
 • Link: (See Ventura County Health Officer orders such as those referenced at https://vcportal.ventura.org)

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)  
 • Order Dates: Extensions and modifications added March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Replaced by the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order on May 7, 2020  
 • Summary: In response to changing conditions during the early pandemic, Ventura County updated its stay‑home orders several times—tightening rules (including bans on gatherings and detailed safety protocols) to curb spread. The measures of March and April established many of the protocols (social distancing, mask use, limits on gatherings) that would persist into Q3 2020 even as formal stay‑home orders were relaxed. Businesses later reopening had to continue operating under these strict guidelines.
 • Link: (Refer to county updates available on official Ventura County websites)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order  
 • Order Dates: Initial order on May 7, 2020 with an amendment on May 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint (effective August 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 order ending local restrictions  
 • Summary: As reopening began in May 2020, Ventura County’s order allowed specific lower‑risk businesses to resume operations with safety measures in place. For Camarillo businesses, this order meant that some establishments (for example, restaurants and retail) could reopen with curbside or outdoor services and, in some cases, limited indoor operations. However, subsequent surges in COVID‑19 cases in Q3 2020 led to renewed closures even after these reopenings.
 • Link: (See details similar to those found at https://www.cdph.ca.gov and Ventura County’s official COVID‑19 reopening pages)

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order  
 • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
 • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired July 6, 2020  
 • Summary: In anticipation of heavy gatherings during the Independence Day weekend and rising COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County ordered its beaches and associated parking areas to be closed temporarily. Although Camarillo is inland, nearby coastal areas were affected, and the resulting drop in tourism and related commerce had spillover effects on local businesses. This short‑term disruption was one of several targeted closures aimed at preventing “super‑spreader” events.
 • Link: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
 • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: Parts were rescinded on October 6, 2020 once the county moved into Tier 2  
 • Summary: This order enforced the statewide rollback that closed indoor operations for sectors like gyms, places of worship, and personal care services that had briefly reopened. For Camarillo, it meant that many businesses which had reopened in early summer were forced back into reduced or outdoor-only service models. The renewed restrictions during Q3 2020 compounded economic pressure on local businesses by reintroducing closures just weeks after reopening.
 • Link: (Refer to Ventura County Health Officer Order details, e.g., from official county portals)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order  
 • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (after additional restrictions in December 2020)  
 • Summary: As COVID‑19 metrics in Ventura County improved in early October 2020, the county moved from the most restrictive Purple tier into the less‑restrictive Red tier. This change allowed certain indoor business operations (such as gyms, churches, and personal care services) to reopen with limitations. For Q3 2020 businesses, while much of the summer was marked by heavy restrictions, this order signalled the first steps toward normalization, even though full reopening was still delayed.
 • Link: (See official Ventura County Health Officer Order documents)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Urgency Ordinance No. 4563  
 • Order Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
 • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initially passed March 31, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: Commercial evictions moratorium expired on September 30, 2020; residential protections were later taken over by state law (AB 3088) on August 31, 2020  
 • Summary: To prevent a wave of business and residential evictions amid severe economic hardship, Ventura County imposed a temporary ban on evictions. This measure provided local businesses (as well as residents) a critical reprieve from losing their leased spaces during the acute phases of the pandemic. In Q3 2020, the moratorium gave struggling Camarillo businesses some breathing room to restructure or seek additional aid, though it did not forgive unpaid rent.
 • Link: (Refer to county urgency ordinance details as published on official Ventura County sites or local news sources)

City of Camarillo Orders

1. Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)  
 • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the city’s emergency declaration remained in effect into 2021 and was formally ended in 2022)  
 • Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID‑19, which activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center. This declaration allowed Camarillo to quickly implement closing measures for city facilities and cancel public events. For local businesses, the sustained emergency status meant that any subsequent city mandates or relief measures (such as adjustments to permitting or temporary fee suspensions) could be swiftly enacted to help them adapt to the evolving pandemic.
 • Link: (Refer to official Camarillo City Council and Camarillo Health Care District communications)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders  
 • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2, issued March 18, 2020 (amended on April 23, 2020)  
 • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020; amended April 23, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded for residential tenants by state law (AB 3088) on August 31, 2020; commercial provisions ended with the local emergency  
 • Summary: To safeguard both residents and small businesses facing crippling revenue losses, the City of Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium that temporarily prevented landlords from evicting tenants facing COVID‑19 related financial hardships. This protection was especially important for small business owners who might have otherwise lost their commercial spaces during the pandemic’s worst periods. Although only a temporary measure that deferred rather than forgave rent arrears, it provided critical stability during Q3 2020.
 • Link: (See related city emergency orders available on Camarillo’s official websites)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
 • Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately)  
 • Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 outdoor capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed)  
 • Summary: In order to help local restaurants survive when indoor dining was either prohibited or heavily restricted, Camarillo’s city council approved a resolution that waived normal zoning requirements and fees to allow temporary outdoor dining setups. This measure enabled restaurants to shift operations outdoors quickly, maintain some operational capacity, and serve customers safely. In Q3 2020, when indoor dining was still subject to frequent rollbacks, this provision was a lifeline for many businesses by partially mitigating revenue losses.
 • Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19

4. Miscellaneous City Measures  
 • Dates: Various throughout spring and summer 2020  
 • Summary: In addition to the above orders, Camarillo took several steps to ease the impact on local businesses. Measures included suspending certain business tax late fees, transitioning permit applications online, and promoting take‑out dining campaigns. These actions, though not orders per se, worked in conjunction with emergency orders to help businesses adapt to a new regulatory and operational environment in Q3 2020.

Overview of Impact on Q3 2020 for Camarillo Businesses

Many of the statewide and county orders originating in March–April 2020 continued to influence business operations well into Q3 2020. Measures like the Stay‑at‑Home Order and its numerous modifications (through Stage 2 reopening and the July 13 rollback) meant that businesses in Camarillo—particularly those in the service, hospitality, and personal care sectors—faced repeated cycles of opening and forced closures. The Blueprint for a Safer Economy introduced a risk‑based framework that, while promising a gradual return to normalcy, meant that for most of Q3 2020 Ventura County (including Camarillo) remained in one of the more restrictive tiers. Local orders such as the Camarillo Temporary Outdoor Dining Program were critical in allowing restaurants to operate during periods when indoor service was again prohibited. Additionally, measures such as eviction moratoria (at both county and city levels) provided temporary relief but also underscored the financial challenges posed by prolonged restrictions. Overall, the overlapping layers of federal, state, county, and city orders created a challenging and continuously evolving environment for Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020.
