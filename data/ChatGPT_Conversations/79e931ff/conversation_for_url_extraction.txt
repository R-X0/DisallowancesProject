To gather the most relevant COVID-related government orders affecting a business in Camarillo, California, during 2020–2021, I need some clarification:

1. Type of Business: Are you referring to a general business, or do you have a specific industry in mind (e.g., retail, restaurant, manufacturing, service-based)? Certain regulations varied by industry.
2. Scope: Should I include federal, state (California), county (Ventura County), and city-level (Camarillo) orders, or do you want only state and local regulations?
3. Level of Detail: Do you need the full text of the orders, or just a summary with key points (such as restrictions on capacity, operational changes, or closures)?

Let me know so I can refine the research accordingly!

COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  Link: https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)  
  Link: (No separate URL provided apart from related announcements – see later federal reflections.)  
  Summary: Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures, but the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Federal Note: The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)  
  Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (e.g. suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (like fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021. Also superseded by later phased reopening orders.  
  Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as  
  Summary: This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to stay at home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors. It forced “non-essential” businesses (like dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or shift to minimal operations, while “essential” businesses (food stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) could remain open with precautions. In Q3 2020, the direct effects of this March order had evolved – by that summer, California was gradually reopening some sectors – but many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints that stemmed from this original shutdown. For example, retail shops and restaurants in Q3 2020 were only allowed limited operations (outdoor or reduced capacity) because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay-home mandate. The order’s continuation (it was in force “until further notice”) reflected the sustained risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and case trends improved by mid-2021. The presence of this order (and its modifying successors) in Q3 2020 meant businesses were still far from normal – it explains why, that quarter, many Camarillo businesses were either closed or severely limited in service.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order)  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), §5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order  
  Link: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=with%20Executive%20Order%20N,finally%20an%20easing%20of%20final  
  Summary: As COVID case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began “Stage 2” of reopening. Consistent with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the March stay-home restrictions. It allowed lower‐risk businesses to reopen with modifications: for example, retail stores (clothing, bookstores, florists, etc.) could offer curbside pickup, and manufacturing supply chains for those retailers could resume. However, higher-risk establishments (dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons, etc.) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order was part of the gradual reopening that led into summer – by July, many local retailers were operating (at least in curbside or limited‐capacity modes) thanks to the Stage 2 easing. The rationale was to revive economic activity while still controlling spread. However, because COVID surged in summer 2020, these initial reopenings were soon paused or reversed (see July order below), which significantly affected businesses in Q3 2020 – many had to scale back operations again just weeks after reopening, underscoring the tenuous situation that quarter.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system; and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions  
  Link: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/8-28-20_Order-Plan-Reducing-COVID19-Adjusting-Permitted-Sectors-Signed.pdf#:~:text=to%20the%20end%20of%20the,certain%20sectors%20in%20order%20to  
  Summary: In July 2020, California experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. In response, the State Health Officer re‐imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. Statewide, this July 13 order closed many indoor operations that had been allowed in Stage 2: for example, restaurants had to shut indoor dining (outdoor and take-out were allowed), bars, breweries and movie theaters were closed, and museums/zoos were closed again indoors. Additionally, counties on the state’s monitoring list (areas with the worst outbreaks, which included Ventura County) had to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non‐critical offices, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and malls. This had a major impact in Q3 2020: Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June had to partially or fully close again in July. For example, restaurants in Camarillo during Q3 2020 could only offer outdoor dining or takeout, and gyms and salons were forced shut for the remainder of the summer. These renewed restrictions in the middle of Q3 dramatically cut business revenues and operations. The reason for this rollback was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID-19” in California – essentially, the summer surge forced the state to hit the “emergency brake,” directly affecting businesses in that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective 6/15/2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system  
  Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease  
  Summary: California unveiled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on Aug. 28, 2020 as a long-term, color-coded tier system for COVID-19 restrictions. This new framework replaced the blunt monitoring-list closures with a graduated, risk-based approach. Every county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk; Red = substantial; Orange = moderate; Yellow = minimal) based on local case rates and test positivity. Each tier set specific rules for businesses: in the Purple tier (the most restrictive), many non-essential indoor business operations were prohibited, whereas in Red or Orange tiers, certain indoor operations could open with capacity limits. Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on Aug. 31, 2020, since case rates were high. In Q3 2020, this meant that although the blanket July closures were lifted, most Camarillo businesses still faced heavy restrictions: retail stores could open indoors with limited capacity, but indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed (only outdoor or take-home services allowed). As conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier by October, easing some rules. The Blueprint’s purpose was to provide a predictable structure: it gradually reopened businesses in Q3/Q4 2020 when COVID metrics improved, but also allowed tightening if metrics worsened. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, the Blueprint meant their operating status was tied to Ventura County’s tier – and during that quarter the county was mostly in the most restrictive tier, explaining why many businesses were still severely limited. The tier system remained in effect until statewide vaccinations and declining cases enabled California to “retire” the Blueprint on June 15, 2021, at which point nearly all business restrictions were lifted.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in the SoCal region Dec. 6, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order statewide (Jan. 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved  
  Links:  
    Regional Order announcement: https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=Late%20Friday%2C%20December%204%2C%202020%2C,the%20day%20before  
    Supplementary information (CDPH): https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority  
  Summary: In late 2020, facing a dire winter surge in COVID-19, California introduced the Regional Stay-at-Home Order – a stricter lockdown based on ICU (intensive care unit) capacity. Ventura County is part of the Southern California region, which dropped below the 15% ICU availability threshold on Dec. 4, 2020, triggering this order. The Regional Order essentially pulled counties back into a full shutdown if their region’s hospitals were in crisis. It required the closure of many business sectors, both indoor and outdoor—for example, restaurants had to stop outdoor dining (takeout only), and personal care services such as hair and nail salons closed entirely. Retail stores, too, had to further reduce capacity (down to 20%). This was the most stringent measure since spring. Although this order took effect in Q4 2020, its impact carried into early Q1 2021, and it highlighted the precarious situation businesses faced. (By Q3 2020, businesses might have hoped the worst was over, but the eventual December order showed that restrictions could return if conditions worsened.) Q3 2020 itself was not directly under the Regional Order, but the looming threat of a resurgent virus meant businesses remained cautious. The Regional Order was lifted on Jan. 25, 2021 when ICU forecasts improved, returning Ventura County to the Purple tier system. The existence of this emergency brake mechanism is a reminder of why Q3 2020 business conditions were tenuous – the pandemic’s trajectory was uncertain, and even a quarter later businesses could face another round of closures initiated by ICU strain.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order ended prior orders)  
  Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded the remaining COVID business restrictions. (California’s underlying state of emergency continued, but without the business closures/tier framework.)  
  Link:  
    Governor’s EO: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the  
  Summary: This pair of orders (Governor’s EO and a State Health Officer Order) marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. They formally terminated the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order (EO N-33-20) and “retired” the Blueprint tier system statewide. Practically, the order lifted capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other COVID-related operating restrictions on businesses. After this date, Camarillo businesses could generally operate at pre-pandemic levels (subject only to any remaining mask rules or industry-specific guidance). In the context of Q3 2020, this June 2021 milestone highlights how long business restrictions persisted – the fact that California did not fully lift business constraints until mid-2021 underscores why Q3 2020 was heavily impacted. Businesses spent that quarter under evolving but continued rules, awaiting a return to normalcy that came roughly three quarters later. The reason this “Beyond the Blueprint” order could be issued was improving public health metrics (declining cases and widespread vaccinations by spring 2021), which were not in place during Q3 2020—meaning businesses in Q3 2020 contended with the stricter earlier orders.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (county emergency remained active; ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, outside our scope)  
  Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=spread%20of%20COVID,and%20local%20public%20health%20officials  
  Summary: Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020 in response to COVID-19. This declaration—quickly ratified by county authorities—did not in itself impose business restrictions but provided the legal basis for the County Health Officer to issue subsequent health orders and coordinate emergency resources. By establishing that a local health emergency existed, Ventura County was able to mirror and enforce state orders (such as shelter-in-place directives) and swiftly act against local COVID-19 outbreaks. In Q3 2020, this emergency status was still active, meaning the county’s authority to affect business operations in Camarillo remained in force. Its persistence into late 2020 was due to the ongoing threat of COVID-19, thereby justifying continued local measures impacting businesses.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s Stay Well at Home order on March 20, 2020 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this order  
  Link: https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing  
  Summary: Prior to the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions on March 17, 2020. That order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain businesses and public facilities (such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, and movie theaters) until at least April 2, 2020. In practice, this meant that even before Gov. Newsom’s statewide mandate, Ventura County had already begun shutting down non-essential venues. Although this order was quickly integrated into a broader stay-at-home order on March 20, its proactive tone demonstrated the county’s early response, setting a precedent that would continue to influence enforcement in Q3 2020.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-Home Order  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order June 15, 2021, which noted the end of the Governor’s stay-home order and lifted remaining local restrictions

  Summary: Ventura County’s Stay Well at Home order, issued on March 20, 2020, was the local companion to California’s statewide stay-home mandate. It required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs or employment in critical sectors, effectively closing non-essential businesses. This order made the state’s directives enforceable locally and introduced county-specific provisions such as definitions for essential businesses and local enforcement protocols. Even as modified reopenings began later, many core restrictions of this order continued to affect businesses in Q3 2020—limiting capacity and operations until it was ultimately phased out with the state’s reopening on June 15, 2021.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols

    – April 20, 2020 (further extended stay-home through 5/15/2020): (See same AAGLA document)  
  Date Rescinded: These orders were superseded by a subsequent May 7, 2020 order that replaced the April directives with a state-aligned “Safely Reopening” framework.  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020 repealed the April 9 and April 20 orders.  
  Summary: Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its stay-home order to address evolving conditions. On March 31, the Health Officer extended the Stay Well at Home order. Then on April 9, as cases surged, an updated order prohibited all gatherings beyond a single household and mandated that remaining essential businesses implement social distancing protocols. An April 20 order further clarified and extended these requirements into May. Although these specific orders were replaced later, their effects lingered into Q3 2020 as businesses maintained safety measures introduced during these early months.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and an amendment on May 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint (effective Aug. 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 order ending all tiered restrictions

  Summary: In early May 2020, as California signaled an initial reopening, Ventura County’s Health Officer issued the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order. The May 7 order lifted some of the stricter earlier directives and allowed lower-risk businesses to resume operations with modifications. On May 20 the order was amended to specifically allow dine-in restaurants and in-store retail to reopen with precautions. This change enabled some Camarillo businesses to operate (albeit at limited capacity) during Q3 2020, even as they remained vulnerable to potential rollbacks when cases surged again in July.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (the order was limited to the Independence Day weekend and expired as scheduled)  
  Link: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County  
  Summary: Anticipating crowding over the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID cases, Ventura County’s health officer ordered beaches closed and beach parking lots off-limits for the July 4th weekend. This short-term order was intended to prevent mass gatherings that could spark “super-spreader” events. Though Camarillo is inland, the measure indirectly affected the local economy by reducing tourism or spending in beach-adjacent areas, and it exemplified the targeted disruption that businesses in Q3 2020 also had to contend with.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county shifted to Tier 2)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020 which allowed certain indoor operations to resume (explicitly rescinding parts of the July 13 order)

  Summary: Following the statewide rollback announced on July 13, 2020, Ventura County issued a local order that re-closed indoor operations for sectors like gyms, fitness centres, places of worship, and personal care services. This order ensured that despite some prior reopenings in May/June, businesses were forced to shut indoor operations again in July. Consequently, many Camarillo businesses such as fitness studios, nail salons, and certain retail establishments were required to operate only outdoors (if at all) during the remainder of Q3 2020. This local measure was a direct response to the summer surge in cases, severely impacting operational capacity and revenue.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (superseded by later Regional Stay-at-Home and subsequent changes)  
  Rescinded By: Effectively superseded by the December 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order (when indoor operations were again curtailed) and later by the state’s full reopening in June 2021

  Summary: By early October 2020, improvements in COVID-19 metrics allowed Ventura County to transition from the most restrictive Purple tier to the less restrictive Red tier. The Oct. 6 order permitted certain businesses to reopen their indoor operations with restrictions (such as capacity limits and enhanced cleaning protocols). This order partially rescinded the July 13 closures and allowed indoor activities to resume in sectors like gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services—providing a ray of hope for businesses that had been largely shut down during Q3 2020. For businesses in late Q3, the approaching Red tier status signalled an eventual easing of restrictions, though it was short-lived when winter surges later necessitated renewed limitations.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: September 30, 2020 (for commercial evictions) and replaced by state law for residential evictions (from Sept 1, 2020 via AB 3088)  
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; Ventura County’s commercial eviction moratorium was extended through Sept. 2020 and then allowed to expire

  Summary: In response to the severe financial distress caused by the pandemic, Ventura County adopted Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 to temporarily ban evictions for both residential and small-business commercial tenants who were unable to pay rent. This ordinance provided critical rent deferral relief, allowing businesses in Camarillo to avoid immediate eviction despite significant revenue losses. Although it did not forgive rent, the moratorium offered a temporary shield against losing commercial property during the worst of the COVID restrictions in Q3 2020.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36 on March 13, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (Camarillo’s local emergency remained active into 2021; lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022, outside our timeframe)  
  Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=capacity%20as%20the%20City%20of,of%20the%20City%20Council%20at  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19. City Manager Dave Norman (acting as EOC Director) issued Order No. 20-1 and the City Council ratified the emergency declaration the same day. This proclamation activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center, allowed for a swift deployment of local resources, and led to the closure of city facilities and cancellation of public events. In Q3 2020, the local emergency was still in effect, meaning the city maintained its authority to enforce continuing COVID-19-related regulations, which in turn affected business operations and customer behavior.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and an Amendment (April 23, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial order), amended April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (Sept 2020 for residential evictions) and expired with the end of the local emergency (for any remaining commercial provisions)  
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (Tenant Relief Act) on Aug. 31, 2020 (for residential tenants) and terminated via a Camarillo City Council Resolution in 2022 for any remaining provisions  
  Link: https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo  
  Summary: Camarillo’s City EOC Order No. 20-2, issued on March 18, 2020 and amended on April 23, 2020, temporarily prohibited evictions of residential and commercial tenants unable to pay rent due to COVID-19 hardships. This ordinance helped protect local businesses in Camarillo by delaying eviction actions during a period of steep revenue loss. For Q3 2020, the protection provided tenants with crucial breathing room, allowing businesses to continue operations despite financial hardships.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximate – resolution passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)  
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022  
  Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19  
  Summary: To help restaurants continue operating under strict indoor dining restrictions, Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020-63 in June 2020. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces. With indoor dining often suspended or heavily curtailed in Q3 2020, many Camarillo restaurants relied on these outdoor setups to maintain some level of service. By easing regulatory burdens temporarily, the resolution provided a vital lifeline for businesses during the challenging mid-pandemic months.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various in 2020 (spring–summer)  
  Summary: In addition to the major orders above, Camarillo undertook several other actions to support local businesses during COVID-19. Measures included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online for construction projects to reduce in-person contact, and promoting take-out dining campaigns to support restaurants. Although not formal “orders,” these actions formed part of the broader COVID response framework that affected business operations by easing certain regulatory pressures while enforcing health safety protocols.

Overall Context and Q3 2020 Impact

Collectively, these federal, state, county, and city orders created a complex and evolving regulatory environment for businesses in Camarillo during the pandemic. In Q3 2020, many establishments continued to grapple with:
– Ongoing restrictions (capacity limits, closure of indoor operations for non-essential businesses) that originated from earlier stay-at-home orders and reopening frameworks.
– The economic and operational disruptions caused by repeated rollbacks (for example, businesses that had begun to reopen in May/June were forced to close or significantly reduce capacity in July).
– The necessity of adapting to temporary measures like outdoor dining zones and eviction moratoria in order to sustain operations amid uncertainty.
The cumulative impact was that Q3 2020 proved to be a particularly challenging quarter for Camarillo businesses, as they operated under strict, sometimes contradictory, public health mandates while trying to maintain economic viability.
