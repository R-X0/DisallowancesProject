1. Issue  
Is West Coast eligible for the Employee Retention Credit based on the adverse impacts of government‐mandated COVID‑19 orders—and, where available, revenue decline evidence—on its operations during the relevant periods? The question requires substantiation using all available qualification evidence, including both observed revenue reductions (if provided) and the regulatory orders that mandated operational restrictions.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Facts  
• West Coast is a general business operating in Camarillo, CA. The business was directly affected by local, county, and state government orders issued in response to the COVID‑19 pandemic.  
• Although no specific revenue decline figures or percentages were provided, the adverse impact on operations is evidenced by the documented government orders that mandated closures, reduced capacity, and operational modifications throughout the pandemic, notably during Q3 2020.  
• The following government orders form the basis of the substantiation evidence that supports the business’s eligibility for the ERC by demonstrating that West Coast faced significant operational challenges due to mandatory public health interventions.

3. Law  
• The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) permits eligible employers to claim a refundable tax credit for wages paid to employees during periods when business operations were partially or fully suspended by governmental orders.  
• Under IRS Notice 2021‑20 and related guidance, a business qualifies if it demonstrates that its operations were either subject to a full or partial shutdown or experienced a significant decline in revenue.  
• In instances where revenue decline data is unavailable or insufficient, the existence of government orders that directly limited business operations is a qualifying factor for the ERC.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Argument  
• West Coast qualifies for the ERC because the business operated under a series of government-imposed restrictions that substantially curtailed normal business activities.  
• The documented federal, state, county, and city orders not only created an environment of uncertainty and restricted operations but also imposed specific limitations—such as complete closures, reduced indoor capacity, and operational rollbacks—that would have directly affected the business’s revenue-generating ability.  
• In light of IRS guidance and ERC rules, even in the absence of detailed revenue decline percentages or figures, the comprehensive list of governmental orders serves as clear and persuasive evidence that West Coast was adversely impacted during the COVID‑19 pandemic.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis of all available evidence—including the significant government orders that mandated reduced operations and capacity restrictions in Camarillo, CA—it is concluded that West Coast qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit. The adverse operational impacts corroborated by the specific orders, along with the qualifying framework provided by IRS Notice 2021‑20 and relevant law, support this eligibility determination.
