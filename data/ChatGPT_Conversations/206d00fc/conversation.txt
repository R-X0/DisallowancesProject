Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
     (Source: The White House Notice – available here:  
     https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation)
   • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023, beyond our timeframe)
   • Rescinded By: The national emergency status was eventually ended as the pandemic response evolved.
   • Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency on March 13, 2020. It activated federal emergency powers and funding streams that indirectly empowered subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While the proclamation did not directly order business closures or impose operational mandates on private enterprises, it set the legal and financial foundation that allowed state and county officials to implement aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, while federal measures such as stimulus payments were available, most direct restrictions on business operations in Camarillo were driven by state and local orders supported by this national emergency status. The enduring emergency status underscored the pandemic’s severity and justified ongoing precautionary measures affecting business conditions during the quarter.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)
     (Source: Executive actions and related CDC guidance; see for example, announcements on federal travel mask requirements.)
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (with the mandate remaining in effect; later lifted by a court order on April 18, 2022)
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent court order ended the CDC travel mask mandate (April 18, 2022; outside the 2020–2021 period)
   • Summary: Though not directly mandating business closures, these federal orders imposed mask-wearing requirements on travelers (on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties) starting in early 2021. They were part of the federal government’s broader initiative to control the virus spread in transit and public spaces connected with travel. For businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020, this measure did not have a direct operational impact as it took effect later; however, its existence illustrates the continued federal efforts to manage the pandemic risk as the nation moved toward reopening and safe operation in 2021. Essentially, while federal mandates provided guidelines for travel-related sectors, the Q3 2020 environment was predominantly shaped by state and local orders.

────────────────────────────────────────
California State Orders

1. State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”
   • Order Number: Not assigned (Governor’s Proclamation)
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
     (Source: Governor Newsom’s declaration – see details at:  
     https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death)
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect; officially ended February 28, 2023)
   • Rescinded By: Officially by a later proclamation in 2023, beyond the period under discussion.
   • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 to mobilize extra state resources, waive certain regulatory hurdles, and prepare for a broader spread of COVID‑19. This declaration provided the legal authority for critical public health actions across all sectors in California. In Q3 2020, the state of emergency was still active, lending legal backing for the restrictive measures imposed on business operations, thereby contributing to the ongoing modifications in how businesses – including those in Camarillo – could operate. This emergency status justified the steady continuation of strict public health orders during the summer months.

2. Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
     (Source: Official document (PDF) available at:  
     https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020)
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
     (Rescinded by Executive Order N‑07‑21 effective June 15, 2021; see also related details on the state reopening)
   • Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) and subsequent orders that ended the stay‑at‑home and related restrictions.
   • Summary: This order mandated that all Californians “stay at home” except for activities deemed essential, thereby enforcing a sharp shutdown of “non-essential” businesses (e.g. dine‐in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) while allowing essential services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and banks to remain open under safety protocols. By Q3 2020, although the direct wording of the March order had been modified and partially relaxed as the state began reopening in stages, many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under restrictions directly derived from this original mandate. The lingering limitations—for example, reduced indoor capacities, outdoor-only services for many operations—reflected the state’s cautious approach due to ongoing health risks. The extended nature of this order played a key role in why Q3 2020 continued to be a challenging period for business operations.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under the authority of Executive Order N‑60‑20)  
     (Source: State Public Health Officer’s order details can be found in official releases such as:  
     https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/ )
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
     (Superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order and later full reopening orders)
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer’s “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021) which formally ended earlier restrictions.
   • Summary: As case trajectories began to level in spring 2020, California began to ease restrictions under a phased reopening agenda. The May 7 order allowed lower‑risk businesses (such as certain retail outlets, curbside pickup operations) to resume activities with modified protocols while maintaining closures for higher‑risk establishments like dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons. In Q3 2020, many businesses in Camarillo were operating under these constraints – benefiting from initial reopening measures while still facing capacity restrictions and intermittent closures when COVID‑19 metrics deteriorated later in the summer. This order was critical to stimulate economic activity but did so cautiously and was later partly withdrawn as wider case surges prompted renewed rollback measures in July 2020.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
     (Source: Order details available from state health department releases; for example, see the order’s cited lines “【18†L49-L57】”)
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint Tier Framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later the “Beyond Blueprint” reopening order on June 15, 2021.
   • Summary: In response to a dramatic surge in COVID‑19 cases in July 2020, the state re-imposed severe restrictions by ordering the closure of many indoor operations that had reopened under Stage 2. This rollback meant that sectors previously allowed some operational activity—such as indoor dining, gyms, and personal care services—were forced to restrict operations to outdoor-only or take-out formats. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that establishments which had hoped for a gradual return to normal in the summer instead encountered another setback when previously opened indoor services were abruptly closed or curtailed. The order was a reaction to worsening public health conditions that made safe reopening unfeasible during that summer, leaving many businesses to operate with significant limitations in Q3 2020.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System
   • Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (issued August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020)  
     (Source: Details on the Blueprint can be found at:  
     https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom )
   • Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (framework effective August 31, 2020)
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
     (Rescinded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order on June 15, 2021)
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effectively ending the tier system when the state fully reopened.
   • Summary: The Blueprint framework replaced the previous, more blunt shutdown orders with a nuanced, color‑coded, risk‑based reopening plan. Counties were assigned tiers (Purple for widespread risk, Red for substantial, Orange for moderate, Yellow for minimal) based on local COVID‑19 metrics, and operating guidelines for businesses varied by tier. In Ventura County (which includes Camarillo), most of Q3 2020 was spent in the most restrictive Purple tier, meaning that indoor operations for many non‑essential businesses were still heavily limited or permitted only under strict conditions. Although the framework allowed for some reopening when conditions improved later in the quarter (and even by October 2020, Ventura County transitioned to the less restrictive Red tier), the tier system in Q3 largely enforced continued limitations. The Blueprint represented a balancing act between mitigating virus spread and cautiously resuming economic activity, and its stringent parameters helped explain why many businesses in Camarillo operated at reduced capacity or remained closed indoors during Q3 2020.

6. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
   • Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; effective December 6, 2020)
     (Source: Details available at:  
     https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=Late%20Friday%2C%20December%204%2C%202020%2C )
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
     (Rescinded when ICU projections improved)
   • Rescinded By: Announcement from State Public Health Officials lifting the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order on January 25, 2021.
   • Summary: Late in 2020, when ICU capacity in the Southern California region fell below 15%, a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was triggered which required counties including Ventura (and thus affecting Camarillo indirectly) to impose even stricter limitations on business activities. This order forced a near–complete shutdown of many sectors (including restaurants, personal care services, and entertainment venues) due to the critical need to preserve hospital capacity. Although the order officially took effect in December 2020 (thus part of Q4 2020), its looming threat and the environment it created reflect the uncertainties business owners faced in Q3 2020—when the prospect of renewed full shutdowns was a constant concern. It underscored that even partial reopenings in Q3 were precarious as hospital capacity remained a critical trigger for reverting to full restrictions.

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Previous Restrictions
   • Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 and accompanying State Health Officer Order
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)
     (Source: See official state documents, for instance:  
     https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the )
   • Date Rescinded: This order itself terminated and rescinded prior stay‑at‑home and tier‑based orders.
   • Rescinded By: The order ended the previous restrictions; although the state of emergency continued, business restrictions were lifted.
   • Summary: With improvements in public health metrics and widespread vaccination by spring 2021, California issued the “Beyond the Blueprint” order, which fully lifted limits such as capacity restrictions and distancing requirements, effectively ending the phased reopening protocol. For Q3 2020 businesses, however, this order came later and serves as a benchmark showing that until mid‑2021, they had been operating under very strict controls. The prolonged nature of earlier orders meant that during Q3 2020, businesses – including those in Camarillo – had to endure months of reduced operations, only to eventually see full normalcy returning several quarters later.

────────────────────────────────────────
Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
     (Source: Ventura County Public Health documents – e.g., announcements at:  
     https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/ )
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained effective until ultimately ended in 2022)
   • Rescinded By: A later resolution by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors (in 2022, outside our analysis period)
   • Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency in response to COVID‑19. Although the declaration did not itself mandate specific business closures, it provided the legal authority for subsequent, more detailed public health orders at the county level that directly affected business operations. During Q3 2020, this emergency remained in effect, ensuring that Ventura County officials had the power to enforce and modify orders that impacted businesses in Camarillo. The sustained local emergency highlighted the county’s commitment to managing the outbreak and justified ongoing restrictions through the summer.

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
     (Source: Early Ventura County Health Officer orders; for example, see details at:  
     https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing )
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)
   • Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer’s order on March 20, 2020
   • Summary: Prior to the statewide mandates, Ventura County issued its own order on March 17, 2020, directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordering the closure of certain venues (such as bars, gyms, and theaters). This early measure set the stage for the county-wide approach that would later be incorporated into the broader “Stay Well at Home” order. Although by Q3 2020 the specifics of this March order had been replaced by more current orders, its aggressive early response established a precedent for strict local controls and reinforced the climate of caution affecting all businesses, including those in Camarillo.

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay-at-Home Order”
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
     (Source: Ventura County Health Officer orders; available at:  
     https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/ )
   • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021  
     (The order was effectively terminated on June 15, 2021 in line with state reopening; see also details at:  
     https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf )
   • Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update, following the state’s full reopening 
   • Summary: Issued on March 20, 2020, the “Stay Well at Home” order forced all Ventura County residents to remain at their homes except for essential needs, thereby requiring nearly all non‑essential businesses to cease in‑person operations. For businesses in Camarillo, which is in Ventura County, this order meant that only those classified as essential (like grocery stores and hospitals) could operate normally, while virtually all other business activities were halted or moved online. Even though direct enforcement of the order was gradually relaxed as reopening measures were introduced, its framework continued to influence operating procedures and safety protocols well into Q3 2020, keeping many businesses at reduced capacity or closed entirely.

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
   • Order Dates:  
     – March 31, 2020: Extended the original Stay Well order through April 19, 2020  
       (Source: Relevant county press releases and documents)
     – April 9, 2020: Added restrictions on gatherings and required social distancing protocols for essential businesses  
       (Source: See details at:  
       https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On )
     – April 20, 2020: Further extended the Stay Well order through May 15, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: These updates were repealed with the issuance of a new “Safely Reopening” order on May 7, 2020
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order on May 7, 2020
   • Summary: During spring 2020, Ventura County repeatedly modified its stay‑at‑home directives. These modifications included extensions of the original order as well as additional provisions to mandate social distancing and limit public gatherings. Although by Q3 2020 these specific orders were no longer active, they established the baseline safety protocols that carried forward into the reopening phase. Many of the operational rules—such as limits on customer capacity and requirements for social distancing—were directly inherited from these early extensions, affecting how businesses in Camarillo could operate later that summer.

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
   • Order Dates: May 7, 2020 (initial order) and May 20, 2020 (amendment)  
     (Source: Ventura County Health Officer press releases; see for example:  
     https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%208%2C%202020 )
   • Date Rescinded: These orders were later superseded by the state’s Blueprint framework (effective August 31, 2020) and ultimately by the full reopening on June 15, 2021.
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s alignment with the state’s Blueprint Tier system and the subsequent “Beyond Blueprint” order.
   • Summary: In early May 2020, Ventura County eased its strict stay‑at‑home rules by authorizing a gradual reopening of lower‑risk businesses. The May 7 order allowed for an initial phase where select types of businesses could open with safety precautions (for example, curbside pickup and limited in‑store operations), and the May 20 amendment extended that reopening to include dine‑in restaurants and retail under controlled conditions. This marked the first phase of economic resumption in the county. For Camarillo businesses, these orders were crucial in allowing operations to resume in Q3 2020—albeit under rigorous social distancing, reduced capacity, and strict operational guidelines. However, the reopening was fragile and subject to rollback when cases spiked again later in the summer.

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
   • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
     (Source: Ventura County press coverage; see:  
     https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County )
   • Date Rescinded: The order expired on July 6, 2020
   • Rescinded By: It expired automatically after the designated holiday weekend.
   • Summary: On the heels of rising COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County ordered its beaches and beach parking lots to be closed during the Independence Day weekend (July 3–5, 2020) to prevent crowding and potential super‑spreader events. Although Camarillo is an inland city, the order affected regional tourism and related economic activities in the broader Ventura area, indirectly reducing customer traffic for nearby businesses. For any local businesses dependent on holiday weekend foot traffic, such targeted closures meant a temporary drop in revenues during what is normally a busy period. The measure was a clear example of the authorities’ willingness to enforce short‑term, targeted restrictions throughout the summer of 2020.

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
     (Source: Ventura County Health Officer Order details; see:  
     https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=PUBLIC%20HEALTH%20AND%20UNDER%20THE,are%20hereby )
   • Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded when the county moved to a less restrictive tier)
   • Rescinded By: A subsequent Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020, which allowed certain indoor operations to resume under the state’s tier system.
   • Summary: In line with the statewide rollback ordered on July 13, 2020, Ventura County issued a local order that enforced the closures of indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, churches, and personal care services. This meant that even if some businesses had reopened in June following the “Safely Reopening” order, many had to shut their indoor services again in July. The local order remained a burden throughout Q3 2020 for sectors that could not easily transition to outdoor operations, such as indoor fitness centers or personal care establishments. The order was a direct response to a surge in COVID‑19 cases during the summer rains, showing how public health data forced businesses to rapidly change their operating modes.

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
     (Source: Official documents from Ventura County; for example, see:  
     https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health )
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (with subsequent orders reimposing restrictions in December 2020 and January 2021)
   • Rescinded By: The December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order (and later changes), with the broader lifting of restrictions on June 15, 2021.
   • Summary: As COVID‑19 case numbers declined, Ventura County shifted from the most restrictive Purple tier into the moderately restrictive Red tier on October 6, 2020. This change allowed some previously closed indoor sectors (such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services) to resume operations under strict guidelines. For Camarillo businesses, this marked the first significant easing after months of stringent orders—offering a glimpse of normalcy in the later part of Q3 2020 (especially in September). However, the improvement was temporary as later surges forced renewed measures. The order highlighted the delicate balance faced in Q3 2020, where improvements allowed some reopening but the risk of resurgence remained high.

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (among others)
   • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (initially passed March 31, 2020 and retroactive to March 2020; see details at:  
     https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19 )
   • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; residential protections were later superseded by state law (California AB 3088) effective from September 1, 2020.
   • Rescinded By: For residential tenants, by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088, August 31, 2020) and for commercial tenants by the county’s own timeline.
   • Summary: Ventura County's Board of Supervisors adopted an urgency ordinance to temporarily halt evictions for tenants (residential as well as small‐business commercial) experiencing financial hardship due to the pandemic. For many Camarillo business owners leasing space in unincorporated areas, the moratorium provided critical protection from eviction despite severe revenue losses. While the measure did not forgive rent, it allowed businesses to defer payments during the darkest months of the pandemic. This safeguard was crucial in Q3 2020, as ongoing restrictions meant that many businesses struggled to generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses.

City of Camarillo Orders

1. Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (Emergency Proclamation)
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
     (Source: Camarillo City documents; see for example, city council resolutions and press releases)
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect until formally lifted in 2022)
   • Rescinded By: A later Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID‑19 emergency (April 2022, beyond our timeframe)
   • Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency which activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and allowed rapid deployment of emergency measures. This declaration led to the closure of city facilities and cancellation of public events, with a direct impact on any business reliant on city-run activities (such as permits, farmers markets, or public programs). For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this maintained an atmosphere of strict public health vigilance and enabled the city to quickly introduce further supportive or regulatory measures. The local emergency declaration reinforced the seriousness of the pandemic response, ensuring that both residents and businesses continued to adhere to health guidelines.

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (issued March 18, 2020) and an Amendment (April 23, 2020)
     (Source: Camarillo City records; see details referenced in local press releases)
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (first order), amended on April 23, 2020
   • Date Rescinded: For residential tenants later superseded by state law (August/September 2020); any remaining commercial protections ended with the eventual conclusion of the local emergency.
   • Rescinded By: California AB 3088 for residential cases, and ultimately by Camarillo’s own procedures when the local emergency ended.
   • Summary: In an effort to prevent undue hardship on local residents and small business owners, Camarillo imposed a moratorium on evictions beginning on March 18, 2020. This order prevented landlords from forcibly evicting tenants, offering a measure of financial relief to businesses (especially small retailers and restaurants) suffering from reduced income. For businesses operating in Q3 2020, the local moratorium helped delay immediate financial collapse and provided time to adapt to the new market conditions even though it did not eliminate rent obligations. The protection was especially critical given the unpredictable nature of revenue streams during ongoing restrictions.

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
   • Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020 (passed in early June 2020)
     (Source: Camarillo City Council documents – for example, see:  
     https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19 )
   • Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions; effectively June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed (or formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)
   • Rescinded By: Automatically sunset when normal zoning rules were reinstated post‑emergency.
   • Summary: To support local restaurants facing extended indoor dining closures, the Camarillo City Council approved Resolution 2020‑63, which waived usual zoning requirements and fees to facilitate temporary outdoor dining setups. These measures allowed restaurants to expand seating outdoors by using parking lots, sidewalks, and other open spaces, thereby partially offsetting losses incurred from indoor closures. In Q3 2020, many establishments in Camarillo relied on these outdoor dining areas as the primary means of serving customers, making this policy a vital lifeline. The order balanced the need for social distancing with the economic necessity of allowing businesses to operate, even if at reduced capacity.

4. Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
   • Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring to summer)
   • Summary: In addition to the major orders above, the City of Camarillo implemented a range of supportive measures. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, transitioning permit processes online to reduce in‑person contact, and even promoting campaigns to boost take‑out and delivery services for local restaurants. While these actions were not formal “orders” in every instance, they formed part of the overall local government response to mitigate the economic impact of COVID‑19 on businesses in Camarillo. Together, these measures illustrate the layered approach taken by federal, state, county, and local authorities in safeguarding public health while attempting to support the business community during Q3 2020.

Additional Context:
It is important to note that the overall regulatory landscape during 2020–2021 was highly dynamic. Federal proclamations provided the overarching emergency framework, but the most direct impacts on business operations in Camarillo came from state and local orders. In Q3 2020, many businesses experienced repeated cycles of reopening and rollback as COVID‑19 case trends fluctuated. This meant that while some orders allowed a cautious resumption of operations, subsequent orders (such as the July 13 statewide rollback) forced additional closures or severe capacity limitations. Also, the eviction moratoriums at both the county and city levels offered critical, if temporary, financial relief for struggling businesses. The combined pressure of social distancing, capacity limits, and economic disruption contributed to an exceptionally challenging quarter for local business owners.
