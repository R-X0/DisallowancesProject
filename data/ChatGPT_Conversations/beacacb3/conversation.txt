# COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, the dates of enactment and (if applicable) rescission or supersession, and a detailed summary (3–5 sentences) describing what the order entailed, how it affected local business operations—especially during the third quarter (Q3) of 2020—and why such measures were implemented.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## Federal Orders

• **Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19**  
  **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on February 24, 2021)  
  **Rescinded By:** Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  **Summary:** This presidential proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It triggered federal emergency powers and unlocked funding mechanisms that indirectly paved the way for state and local lockdowns and restrictions. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it provided the legal foundation that empowered stricter measures at lower government levels. In Q3 2020, while federal direct restrictions were minimal, the overall emergency context meant that state and local authorities had the backing to impose significant limitations on business operations.

• **CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel**  
  **Date Enacted:** January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective February 1, 2021  
  **Date Rescinded:** Not rescinded in 2021 (remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  **Rescinded By:** A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the mandate (outside the 2020–2021 period)  
  **Summary:** Under the new administration, federal mask-wearing rules were mandated for certain travel-related settings such as airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. Although these mandates targeted travel and not private business operations directly, they reflected ongoing federal efforts to mitigate virus spread. For Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020, these rules did not have a direct operational impact (since they were instituted in 2021), but they are indicative of the multi-layered response to COVID‑19 that continued into 2021.

  (Reference to Executive Order 13998 and CDC guidance; specific URLs were provided in the original serialized document.)

*Federal Note:* Most of the direct restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 originated from state and local orders. Federal actions (such as the national emergency declaration) primarily served to provide funding and legal authority rather than to directly dictate business operations.

─────────────────────────────────────────────  
## California State Orders

• **State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency**  
  **Order Number:** N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  **Date Enacted:** March 4, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Remained in effect through 2020–2021 (ended February 28, 2023)  
  **Summary:** Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, in response to rapidly increasing COVID‑19 cases. This proclamation empowered the state to issue sweeping orders, suspend certain regulations, and mobilize resources—all of which played a vital role in later imposing lockdowns and operational restrictions on businesses. In Q3 2020, the state of emergency was still active, thereby legally justifying the ongoing public health orders that limited business operations.

• **Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order**  
  **Date Enacted:** March 19, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021  
  **Rescinded By:** Executive Order N‑07‑21 issued on June 11, 2021 (which terminated the Stay‑at‑Home order effective June 15, 2021) and subsequent phased reopening orders.  
  **Summary:** This order mandated that all Californians stay at home except for essential activities, forcing non‑essential businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail outlets, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) either to close completely or operate at minimal capacity. Although by Q3 2020 some easing had occurred through gradual reopening, many Camarillo businesses were still working under limits derived from this original shutdown. In effect, even if the order itself had been modified, its legacy meant that many sectors continued with restrictions (for example, outdoor-only service and capacity limits) well into Q3 2020.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)**  
  **Order Date/Identifier:** May 7, 2020 (issued in conjunction with EO N‑60‑20)  
  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021  
  **Rescinded By:** Later “Beyond Blueprint” Order issued on June 11, 2021  
  **Summary:** As emerging data suggested a plateau in COVID‑19 cases, the State Public Health Officer relaxed some restrictions on May 7, 2020. Under this Stage 2 order, lower-risk businesses—such as retail stores allowed for curbside pickup and supportive manufacturing sectors—were permitted to reopen with modifications. However, higher‑risk venues (like dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed at that time. For Q3 2020, this order set the groundwork for the partial reopening that occurred in summer, even though subsequent surges in cases in July led to renewed restrictions.

• **State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening**  
  **Order Date:** July 13, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  **Rescinded By:** A later Blueprint Order (August 28, 2020) and ultimately by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order  
  **Summary:** In July 2020, as a sharp surge in COVID‑19 cases was observed, the state re‑imposed restrictions on sectors that had just been reopened. This order forced indoor closures for many businesses—even those that had resumed limited operations in Stage 2—such as forcing restaurants to cease indoor dining (allowing only outdoor or take‑out), and closing indoor operations for bars, movie theaters, and similar venues. The rollback had a severe impact in Q3 2020 because businesses that had resumed operations in May/June had to shutter or significantly curtail activity again in July.

• **“Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System**  
  **Order Identifier:** State Public Health Officer Order issued on August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** June 15, 2021  
  **Rescinded By:** “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021  
  **Summary:** Unveiled on August 28, 2020, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy introduced a color‑coded tier system that assigned each county a tier (Purple, Red, Orange, or Yellow) reflecting its COVID‑19 risk level. Under this system, each tier prescribed specific operating guidelines for businesses. Ventura County (including Camarillo) was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier when the order took effect, meaning many indoor activities were prohibited or severely limited. By linking business operations to real‑time local COVID‑19 data, the system sought to provide predictable—but strict—rules that heavily influenced Q3 2020 conditions.

• **Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown**  
  **Order Date:** December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered for the Southern California region on December 6, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** January 25, 2021  
  **Rescinded By:** A statewide announcement lifting the order when ICU projections improved  
  **Summary:** In response to a winter surge in cases and critically low ICU capacity (falling below 15% availability in parts of Southern California), the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was issued. Although this order directly applied in Q4 2020, its existence underscored the continuing risk projection that had its roots in the summer surge. For Q3 2020 businesses, this looming threat of a renewed, strict shutdown (had conditions worsened) kept operators cautious, even though the order itself did not affect Q3 directly.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (Refer to official CDPH/California documents; see [59†L55-L63] and [54†L355-L363].)

• **“Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay‑at‑Home/Tiers**  
  **Order Identifier:** Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order issued June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Not applicable (this order ended previous restrictions)  
  **Summary:** Issued as the state’s COVID‑19 situation dramatically improved, this order formally terminated the long‑standing Stay‑at‑Home mandate and dismantled the Blueprint tier system. Although it applied in mid‑2021, its issuance highlights that Q3 2020 businesses had to operate under restrictions for many months afterward. The “Beyond the Blueprint” order allowed Camarillo businesses to eventually return to normal operations, but it also serves as evidence of the prolonged period during which business restrictions were enforced—including the challenging Q3 2020 period.

## Ventura County Orders

• **Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency**  
  **Order/Proclamation Date:** March 12, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in force; ended in 2022)  
  **Summary:** On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency. Although the declaration itself did not impose restrictions, it granted the county the authority needed to issue subsequent health orders and coordinate emergency resources. This local emergency provided the legal basis for later restrictions that affected business operations in Camarillo, and it remained in effect throughout 2020–2021.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (See Ventura County official documentation; referenced by [38†L19-L27].)

• **Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions**  
  **Order Date:** March 17, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
  **Summary:** Before the statewide mandate, Ventura County issued its own order on March 17, 2020, directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordering the closure of certain public venues and non‑essential businesses. This early measure meant that local bars, gyms, movie theaters, and many restaurants were forced to close or switch to take‑out operations. Although soon incorporated into a broader county “Stay Well at Home” directive, this order set an early tone for aggressive local action.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (Refer to Ventura County Health Officer orders; see [61†L78-L83].)

• **“Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay‑Home Order**  
  **Order Date:** March 20, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Officially ended on June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening; formally lifted on June 15, 2021)  
  **Summary:** Issued on March 20, 2020, this order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities. It was the local counterpart to California’s statewide order, dictating that every non‑essential business (including those in Camarillo) cease in‑person operations unless they qualified as essential. Even as some easing occurred later, the order’s framework continued to affect business conditions in Q3 2020 through capacity limits and modified operation rules.

  (See official county order documents [61†L95-L102] and related updates [7†L29-L35].)

• **Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols**  
  **Order Dates:** March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Repealed by the May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order  
  **Summary:** Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County repeatedly updated its initial “Stay Well at Home” order: on March 31 the order was extended; on April 9 a ban on gatherings and requirements for social distancing at essential businesses were added; and on April 20 the restrictions were further tightened. Although these early measures were later replaced by a reopening framework, they established the rigorous protocols that continued to influence business operations (such as mandatory distancing and masking) well into Q3 2020.  
  **Source Links:**  
  (Refer to [6†L73-L77], [13†L49-L57], and [61†L95-L102].)

• **“Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)**  
  **Order Dates:** May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amended)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the state’s Blueprint order and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening  
  **Summary:** As the state began to ease restrictions in May 2020, Ventura County issued its “Safely Reopening” order allowing certain lower‑risk sectors to resume operations. Initially, the May 7 order allowed businesses like curbside retail and supporting manufacturing to reopen, and the May 20 amendment extended permissions to dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail under strict health protocols. For Q3 2020, these orders meant that many Camarillo businesses had an opportunity to reopen; however, the gains were short-lived as renewed restrictions in July forced many to close or scale back again.

• **Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)**  
  **Order Date:** June 30, 2020 (applied for July 3–5, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Automatically expired July 6, 2020  
  **Summary:** With concerns over large gatherings during the Independence Day weekend, Ventura County ordered a temporary closure of local beaches and the associated parking areas to prevent super‑spreader events. Although Camarillo is an inland city, many residents travel to the coastal areas, so this order indirectly reduced customer traffic in related sectors (e.g., restaurants and outdoor recreation). This measure is illustrative of the “targeted closures” that characterized the pandemic response in Q3 2020.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (See [39†L5-L12].)

• **Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback**  
  **Order Date:** July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 (as the county moved to Tier 2)  
  **Summary:** In line with the statewide rollback issued on July 13, 2020, Ventura County enforced a local order that re‑closed indoor operations for several sectors including gyms, places of worship, and personal care services. This order meant that many Camarillo businesses—especially those that had reopened under the May reopening—faced a second wave of shutdowns in July 2020. When conditions improved slightly in fall, on October 6 the county allowed a partial reopening of these sectors. The order underscores how rapidly reopening conditions could reverse in response to surges in cases during Q3 2020.

  (Refer to [9†L31-L39].)

• **Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020**  
  **Order Date:** October 6, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** January 25, 2021 (after subsequent orders)  
  **Summary:** As Ventura County’s COVID‑19 case numbers improved, it moved to the “Red Tier” on October 6, 2020. This order authorized the reopening of indoor operations for certain sectors (such as gyms, churches, and personal care services) under strict capacity and hygiene guidelines. Although it provided hope for improved business conditions at the tail end of Q3 (and into early Q4), the relaxation was later reversed in December when the pandemic situation worsened again.

  (See [9†L13-L21] and [9†L31-L39].)

• **Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)**  
  **Order/Ordinance Number:** Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (with subsequent extensions)  
  **Date Enacted:** Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; first passed March 31, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Residential protections replaced via state law on August 31, 2020 (commercial moratorium lasted through September 30, 2020)  
  **Summary:** To help both residents and small business owners facing severe revenue losses, Ventura County issued an eviction moratorium that temporarily barred landlords from evicting tenants who were unable to pay due to pandemic-related economic hardship. For Camarillo businesses, especially those renting commercial spaces, this measure provided critical relief by preventing premature closures due to eviction proceedings. Although it did not forgive rent, it allowed businesses the chance to defer payments during the lean months of Q3 2020.

## City of Camarillo Orders

• **Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency**  
  **Order Number:** EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
  **Date Enacted:** March 13, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Remained in effect during 2020–2021 (ended in April 2022)  
  **Summary:** The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020, activating its Emergency Operations Center and enabling rapid response measures. As a result, city facilities such as City Hall, the public library, and community centers were closed, and public events were canceled. This proactive local measure both reflected and reinforced the seriousness of the pandemic, influencing resident behavior and, consequently, the business climate in Q3 2020 by encouraging reduced public activity.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (See [38†L29-L37].)

• **Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions**  
  **Order Numbers:** EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (issued March 18, 2020) and its amendment (April 23, 2020)  
  **Date Enacted:** March 18, 2020 (amended on April 23, 2020)  
  **Date Rescinded:** Superseded by state law (August–September 2020 for residential) and ultimately ended when the local emergency expired  
  **Summary:** Camarillo followed county efforts by enacting its own eviction moratorium to prevent landlords from evicting tenants—residential or commercial—facing financial hardship caused by the pandemic. This provided a legal freeze on eviction proceedings and helped keep businesses from being forced out of their leased locations during the worst periods of Q3 2020. While this did not absolve rent liabilities, it temporarily prevented one more pathway to business closures during the crisis.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (See [35†L218-L222].)

• **Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program**  
  **Date Enacted:** Approximately June 10, 2020  
  **Date Rescinded:** Expired with the end of local COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021)  
  **Summary:** To mitigate the impact of indoor dining bans and help local restaurants survive, Camarillo’s City Council approved Resolution No. 2020-63, which waived certain zoning and fee requirements to allow restaurants to create temporary outdoor dining areas. This measure enabled eateries to expand their service zones to sidewalks, parking lots, or other open areas, thereby offsetting revenue losses incurred from prolonged indoor dining restrictions in Q3 2020. It was a critical adaptation tool that helped sustain the local food service industry during the pandemic.  
  **Source Link:**  
  (See [38†L2-L8] and [13†L51-L59].)

• **Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions**  
  **Dates:** Various during spring–summer 2020  
  **Summary:** In addition to formal orders, the City of Camarillo implemented several supportive measures such as suspending late fees on business taxes, shifting permit processes online, and launching campaigns to promote take‑out dining. These actions, while not “orders” in the regulatory sense, contributed to a broader environment of regulatory relief and support designed to help local businesses cope with the economic and operational challenges of the pandemic in Q3 2020.

Additional Notes  
• The federal orders primarily established the national emergency and guidance for funding and policy, while the more direct limitations on business operations originated at the state, county, and city level.  
• Q3 2020 was particularly challenging because many businesses that had reopened in stages during May and June were forced to adjust again after a summer surge, resulting in a patchwork of closures, re‐openings, capacity limits, and additional protective orders.  
• The eviction moratoria (at both the county and city level) offered temporary relief to businesses and residents alike by delaying loss of tenancy during periods of financial strain.
