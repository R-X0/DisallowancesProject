RE: Formal Protest to ERC Disallowance for Quarter 1 2021  
Tax Period: 1st Quarter 2021  

Dear Appeals Officer:

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing 45's Business’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for the first quarter of 2021. The disallowance was based on an assertion that no governmental orders were in effect during the period that imposed restrictions on our operations. We respectfully disagree. Our operations were substantially impacted by numerous COVID-19 government orders issued by federal, state, county, and city authorities. In addition, we experienced dramatic revenue declines that satisfy the ERC qualification thresholds. In this protest, we provide a detailed timeline of the pertinent government orders and present a dedicated "REVENUE DECLINE DATA" section substantiating the qualification on both grounds.

Below is a chronological timeline of the COVID-19 government orders that were active during Quarter 1 2021. Each order is presented in the required format:

  Order Number: Proclamation 9994  
  Date Enacted: 03/13/2020  
  Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
  Order Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak and activated federal emergency powers and funding. It established the legal context for numerous subsequent orders that imposed health and safety protocols affecting business operations.  
  Impact on Quarter: In Quarter 1 2021, this proclamation provided the underlying federal authority for COVID‑19 restrictions that affected travel, gatherings, and, by extension, routine business activities.

  Order Number: CDC/FAA Mask Mandates  
  Date Enacted: 01/21/2021  
  Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
  Order Summary: This order required masks in airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and on federal property to protect public health during travel. It followed detailed safety guidelines that came into force as part of the federal effort to limit virus transmission.  
  Impact on Quarter: During Quarter 1 2021, this mandate affected employee travel protocols and imposed additional safety measures on any business-related travel, thereby contributing to operational modifications.

• Order Name: State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: State Emergency Proclamation  
  Date Enacted: 03/04/2020  
  Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
  Order Summary: This proclamation empowered state authorities to mobilize resources and issue broad restrictions to mitigate COVID‑19 spread. It served as the basis for subsequent orders that limited business activities and regulated public gatherings.  
  Impact on Quarter: In Quarter 1 2021, the state emergency remained active and reinforced public health measures that partially suspended normal business operations, influencing similar restrictions nationwide.

• Order Name: Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
  Order Number: Executive Order N‑33‑20  
  Date Enacted: 03/19/2020  
  Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021  
  Order Summary: This order mandated that residents remain at home except to access essential services, resulting in the closure or significant limitation of non‑essential business operations. It was a major instrument in reducing community spread of the virus.  
  Impact on Quarter: Although originating in California, the principles embodied in this order influenced broader public health expectations. Its active status in Quarter 1 2021 contributed to a restrictive operating environment that paralleled national measures impacting our business.

• Order Name: State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home Order

  Order Summary: This order allowed lower‑risk sectors to reopen under strict safety protocols while maintaining distancing and other precautions. It modified earlier stay‑at‑home measures by establishing guidelines for phased reopening.  
  Impact on Quarter: In Quarter 1 2021, although businesses were in a reopening phase, the lingering restrictions and mandated safety protocols continued to limit operations and service capacity.

• Order Name: State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Number: State PHO Order (July 13, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: 07/13/2020  
  Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021  
  Order Summary: This order reimposed restrictions on indoor operations in response to a surge in COVID‑19 cases. It mandated that many businesses scale back or temporarily cease certain activities to reduce transmission risks.

  Order Number: Blueprint for a Safer Economy  
  Date Enacted: 08/31/2020  
  Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021  
  Order Summary: This framework introduced a color‑tier system that prescribed restrictions based on local COVID‑19 metrics. It set capacity limitations and operational guidelines for businesses in various risk categories.  
  Impact on Quarter: In Quarter 1 2021, the continued enforcement of tier‑based restrictions meant that businesses operated at reduced capacity, further limiting normal business activities.

  Impact on Quarter: Although its primary enforcement was in early January 2021, the regional order contributed to a broader atmosphere of operational restriction during the first quarter.

• Order Name: Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
  Order Number: Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
  Date Enacted: 03/12/2020  
  Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
  Order Summary: This declaration provided Ventura County with the authority to implement emergency health directives and coordinate resources during the pandemic. It established a legal basis for localized COVID‑19 restrictions.  
  Impact on Quarter: While specific to Ventura County, this emergency declaration exemplifies the type of local governmental actions that, by analogy, underscored the necessity of restrictive measures in affected jurisdictions during Quarter 1 2021.

  Date Enacted: 03/20/2020

  Date Enacted: 10/06/2020

  Order Summary: This order signaled a shift toward reopening while still maintaining limited indoor operations through capacity restrictions. It was indicative of the cautious approach adopted by local authorities.

  Date Rescinded: Still in effect  
  Order Summary: This proclamation declared a local emergency to coordinate city resources and enforce additional health directives. It empowered the city to implement protective measures affecting public and business operations.  
  Impact on Quarter: The persistence of this local emergency status during Quarter 1 2021 reinforced the environment of restrictions that necessitated operational curtailments similar to those impacting broader jurisdictions.

• Order Name: Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Order Number: Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63  
  Date Enacted: 06/10/2020 (approximate)  
  Date Rescinded: 06/15/2021  
  Order Summary: This resolution permitted temporary outdoor dining by waiving certain zoning requirements and fees, thereby allowing restaurants to operate in a modified capacity. It was designed to mitigate revenue losses from indoor dining closures.

REVENUE DECLINE DATA

The purpose of this section is to document the exact revenue decline figures as provided for the affected quarters and demonstrate that 45's Business meets the ERC qualification criteria based on a significant reduction in gross receipts.

For the primary quarter under protest, the revenue figures are as follows. In Quarter 1 2021, 45's Business reported EXACTLY $345 in revenue compared to Quarter 1 2019 revenue of EXACTLY $54325234. This represents an EXACT decline of $54324889, or EXACTLY 100.00% decline, which clearly qualifies for the ERC under the applicable guidelines.

Additional revenue data for subsequent quarters is provided below for completeness:
• Q2 2021: EXACTLY $345 compared to Q2 2019: EXACTLY $3552452345 = EXACTLY 100.00% decline (Qualifies for ERC)  
• Q3 2021: EXACTLY $345 compared to Q3 2019: EXACTLY $3245345 = EXACTLY 99.99% decline (Qualifies for ERC)

In conclusion, the dramatic revenue declines documented above, combined with the active imposition of federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 government orders, substantiate that 45's Business experienced both a partial suspension of operations and a significant decline in gross receipts during Quarter 1 2021. Both factors independently satisfy the ERC eligibility criteria.

We respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our ERC claim for the first quarter of 2021. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you require further documentation or clarification regarding the enclosed evidence.

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this protest submission and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information herein is true, correct, and complete.

Sincerely,

[Signature]
