COVID‑19 Orders Business Impact

–––––
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the emergency continued and was later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
  Rescinded By: Later termination by Congress  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, helping set the stage for state and local shutdowns. Although it did not mandate specific closures for businesses, its consequences—in terms of enabling subsequent restrictions—had an indirect impact on all operations. In Q3 2020, while Camarillo businesses operated under the power granted by the emergency, strict state and local measures continued to limit business operations.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 for travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Remained in effect throughout 2021 (later lifted in 2022 after a court order)  
  Rescinded By: Court order on April 18, 2022  
  Summary: Although not directly aimed at closing businesses, these mandates required masks on all forms of interstate travel and on federal property. They were intended to protect travellers as the pandemic continued. For Camarillo businesses, especially those tied to travel (such as transportation or tourism-related services), these rules indicated a continued federal commitment to public safety. However, for Q3 2020 the direct impact was minimal since these restrictions began in early 2021; they nonetheless illustrate the evolving federal response as the pandemic progressed.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”
  Order Number: Not applicable (Governor’s proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–21 (remained active throughout the period)  
  Rescinded By: Officially ended by a proclamation in February 2023  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020, which empowered health authorities to issue sweeping measures—including restrictions on business operations. This emergency status provided the legal basis for later closure and capacity orders. In Q3 2020, because the state of emergency was still in place, businesses were subject to ongoing restrictions and evolving health directives. The sustained emergency justified persistent limitations designed to protect public health.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide stay‑at‑home order and paved the way for reopening  
  Summary: This order mandated that all Californians stay at home except for essential activities, effectively shuttering all “non‑essential” businesses. It forced closures or forced major operational changes for many businesses including restaurants, retail, and entertainment venues. Even by Q3 2020, although some sectors had been allowed a limited reopening, the lingering effect of this order—and its subsequent modifications—meant that many businesses were still constrained in terms of capacity and service options. The prolonged presence of the stay‑at‑home framework was a direct response to ongoing public health risks.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order pursuant to EO N‑60‑20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Summary: As case numbers plateaued in spring, this order began California’s Stage 2 reopening by relaxing the previous stay‑at‑home restrictions for lower‑risk businesses. It permitted curbside pickup for retail stores and allowed manufacturing that supported reopened sectors to resume operations. However, higher‑risk businesses such as dine‑in restaurants and gyms mostly remained closed. For Camarillo, this set the stage for the summer reopening—with caution—as businesses began to operate on a limited and regulated basis in Q3 2020, only to face subsequent rollbacks.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 as California adopted the Blueprint tier system; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The Blueprint Order (august 28, 2020) and later the “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)
  Summary: In response to a spike in COVID‑19 cases during the summer surge, California re‑imposed strict closures on many indoor operations. This meant that businesses which had reopened under Stage 2—such as restaurants with indoor dining, bars, gyms, and personal care services—had to close their indoor operations again. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses experienced this mid‑summer rollback, forcing shifts to outdoor or take‑out only operations and a significant hit to revenue. The order was a clear signal that the public health emergency was worsening, and drastic measures were required to slow transmission.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: Announced August 28, 2020, effective August 31, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)  
  Summary: This framework replaced the earlier closure regime with a graduated, risk‑based system assigning counties to tiers (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID metrics. Ventura County, and therefore Camarillo, was initially placed in the worst (Purple) tier, meaning very strict restrictions remained in place for many indoor operations. Businesses such as restaurants, gyms, and theaters were either limited to outdoor operations or faced heavy capacity restrictions. This system provided a planned yet fluid structure to gradually ease restrictions as local conditions improved; however, during Q3 2020 most businesses still experienced significant limits, with only limited easing as Ventura County slowly improved.

• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; effective December 6, 2020 in Southern California)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Lifted statewide when ICU projections improved  
  Summary: In late 2020, when hospital ICU capacity in parts of Southern California fell below the threshold, California issued this Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order that mandated even stricter restrictions than before. This order required the closure (or severe limitation) of various business sectors—including restaurants (indoor and outdoor dining) and retail—to preserve critical hospital capacity. Although it was a Q4 2020 measure, it reflects the overall uncertain environment felt by businesses in Q3 as well, with many already preparing for potential re‑closures. It effectively underscored that until hospital resources could be assured, any easing of restrictions could be swiftly reversed.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Prior Restrictions
  Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order terminated previous restrictions)  
  Rescinded By: This order itself ended the earlier orders  
  Summary: These orders formally ended the stay‑at‑home mandate and the Blueprint tier system, allowing businesses to operate at near normal capacity. While extremely relevant for signaling the eventual return to full operations, the fact that these restrictions were not lifted until June 2021 highlights the extent of the limitations imposed on Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020. The order served as a benchmark for how long restrictions lasted and how deeply Q3 2020 businesses were affected by continuing limitations.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–21 (continued until later, ending in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A subsequent Board of Supervisors resolution (March 2022)  
  Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County declared a Local Health Emergency which empowered the County Health Officer to later issue necessary orders. Although the declaration by itself did not impose specific operational restrictions, it provided the authority for enforcing other health orders that directly impacted businesses. In Q3 2020 this emergency remained active, ensuring that the county had the power to intervene and enforce ongoing COVID‑19 safety measures. Its continuation underscored the persistent health threat and justified why many local businesses were harshly regulated.
  Sources/Citations: (See 【38†L19-L27】)

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by a broader “Stay Well at Home” order  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020  
  Summary: This early order from the county directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of many nonessential venues even before the statewide mandate. It initially closed bars, nightclubs, gyms, and limited restaurants to take‑out only. Though quickly incorporated into later orders, it set a strict local tone that influenced subsequent, broader restrictions. The county’s rapid response meant that by Q3 2020 households and businesses alike continued to operate under the expectation of severe limitations.
  Sources/Citations: (Referenced as 【61†L78-L83】)

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Formally lifted June 11, 2021 (in step with state reopening)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s update on June 15, 2021  
  Summary: This order required all residents of Ventura County to remain in their homes except for essential activities and for essential business operations. In Camarillo, as part of Ventura County, it forced nearly all nonessential business operations to cease or be severely curtailed. Although the order was amended over time to allow for phased reopening, many of its core restrictions—derived from its original language—persisted through Q3 2020. It thus represents one of the key reasons that local businesses were still operating under modified but strict limitations during that quarter.
  Sources/Citations: (See 【61†L95-L102】 and local references 【7†L29-L35】)

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)
  Order Dates: 
      – March 31, 2020: Extension of the stay‑home order until April 19, 2020  
      – April 9, 2020: Added a gathering ban and mandated safety protocols for open essential businesses  
      – April 20, 2020: Further extension of the order through May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Replaced by the May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 order  
  Summary: In the early weeks, Ventura County periodically extended and refined its “Stay Well at Home” measures. They tightened gathering restrictions on April 9 and extended the order multiple times as the virus spread. Although these orders were replaced as the county began reopening in May 2020, the safety protocols and restrictions they established continued to affect how businesses reopened in Q3 2020—requiring physical distancing and rigorous sanitation protocols.
  Sources/Citations: (See 【6†L73-L77】, 【13†L49-L57】, and 【61†L99-L107】)

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 (initial) and May 20, 2020 (amendment)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint order on August 31, 2020 and by the June 15, 2021 reopening  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020  
  Summary: With a slow decrease in cases, Ventura County issued its reopening order that allowed lower‑risk businesses to reopen with strict guidelines. It permitted curbside pickup, enhanced in‑store operations, and allowed dine‑in services outdoors or at limited indoor capacity once state‐approved. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this order provided an opportunity for a cautious return to some economic activity—but they still operated under strict safety requirements. Unfortunately, a subsequent surge in summer 2020 forced another round of rollbacks later that quarter.
  Sources/Citations: (Referenced as 【6†L64-L72】 and 【29†L437-L445】)

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for July 3–5, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Automatically expired after July 5, 2020  
  Rescinded By: The order was limited to the Independence Day weekend  
  Summary: To prevent crowding during the public holiday, the county closed beaches (and parking areas) for the July 4 weekend. While Camarillo is inland, the order affected tourism and beach‑related commerce in neighboring coastal areas. This short‑term order exemplified the abrupt, targeted closures that even temporarily disrupted economic activity throughout the region during Q3 2020.
  Sources/Citations: (【39†L5-L12】)

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded October 6, 2020 as the county moved to a lower tier  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  Summary: Following the statewide rollback, Ventura County issued a local order to reinforce closures of indoor operations for gyms, fitness centers, churches, and personal care services. In Q3 2020 this directly affected many Camarillo businesses that had attempted to reopen during the spring reopening phase. Indoor operations were closed and only outdoor or take‑out services were permitted where possible. This order exemplified the mid‑summer setback many local businesses experienced due to a resurgence in case numbers.
  Sources/Citations: (See 【9†L31-L39】)

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Remained until later changes in early 2021 (e.g. Regional stay‑at‑home order in December)  
  Rescinded By: Superseded by subsequent state orders and later by full reopening on June 15, 2021  
  Summary: With improved health metrics, Ventura County moved into the Red tier of the state’s Blueprint system and allowed a partial easing of restrictions. This order permitted indoor reopening of gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services with capacity limits. While the order officially came into effect just after Q3 2020, its anticipation was a relief and a sign that the sacrifices endured in Q3—the extended closures—could soon pay off. Nonetheless, businesses had already suffered during Q3.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (with subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; first passed March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; later residential protections superseded by California AB 3088 starting September 1, 2020  
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, preempted by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088); commercial protections were allowed to expire per county records  
  Summary: This ordinance prevented landlords in unincorporated Ventura County from evicting tenants—including small businesses—facing rent nonpayment due to COVID‑19 hardship. This provided critical financial relief during the months of economic shutdown. In Q3 2020, while many businesses struggled with reduced income, the moratorium shielded them from the risk of losing their premises. Although it did not forgive the debt, it allowed time for businesses to recover.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Later City Council resolution ending the emergency (April 2022)  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID‑19. This activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center, enabling rapid coordination and resource allocation. The emergency declaration led to the closure of city facilities and cancellation of public events, indirectly affecting local businesses by reducing foot traffic and delaying permit processes. For Q3 2020, the continued emergency status meant that additional local measures could be imposed at short notice.
  Sources/Citations: (【38†L29-L37】)

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (issued March 18, 2020), amended April 23, 2020  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law on August 31, 2020 for residential tenants; city provisions ended when the local emergency concluded  
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (for residential) and later city resolution  
  Summary: Camarillo implemented its own eviction moratorium to prevent the eviction of tenants—both residential and commercial—unable to pay rent due to COVID‑19. This measure provided crucial protection for local businesses that might otherwise have faced eviction during a period of revenue loss. In Q3 2020, businesses could depend on this temporary relief to continue operations despite financial hardships, although the deferred rent would need to be repaid later.
  Sources/Citations: (Referenced as 【35†L218-L222】)

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Automatic sunset as restrictions were lifted and normal zoning rules resumed  
  Summary: In response to the limitations on indoor dining, Camarillo City Council passed Resolution 2020‑63 to temporarily waive certain zoning requirements and fees, allowing restaurants to set up outdoor dining spaces. This measure enabled local eateries to serve customers safely outdoors when indoor operations were curtailed by state and county orders. For Q3 2020, this was a lifeline for many restaurants, helping them sustain revenue despite the repeated closures of indoor dining. It demonstrates the city’s effort to balance public health needs with economic viability.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Actions
  Dates: Various throughout spring–summer 2020  
  Summary: Beyond the formal orders above, the City of Camarillo also suspended late fees for business taxes, shifted permit processes online, and promoted take‑out dining to support local businesses. These initiatives, although not “orders” in the legal sense, were part of the city’s broader COVID‑19 response designed to lessen the economic blow on businesses. Collectively, these actions contributed to a complex regulatory landscape that Camarillo businesses had to navigate during Q3 2020.

Assistant Conclusion:
All of the above government orders and related measures collectively shaped the business landscape for a “business” located in Camarillo, California, during the pandemic years 2020–2021. In Q3 2020 particularly, many businesses were caught between phases of reopening and re‑closure as case counts fluctuated and state/county orders evolved. The detailed summaries explain both what each individual order imposed and its direct or indirect effect on business operations during that turbulent quarter.
