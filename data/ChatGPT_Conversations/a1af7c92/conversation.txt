COVID-19 Orders Business Impact

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. For each entry the following items are provided where available:
• Order number or identifying code
• Name or title of the order/proclamation
• Date the order was enacted
• Date the order was rescinded (or information on how it was superseded)

──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not officially rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
   • Rescinded By: A later congressional action beyond the 2020–2021 scope  
   • Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, thereby indirectly empowering state and local public health measures and lockdowns. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the legal and operational context for subsequent restrictions. In Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo were affected indirectly through the cascade of state and local orders enabled by the national emergency, which underscored the severity of the pandemic and justified continued restrictions.

   • (Citation reference: [43†L106-L115])

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: These mandates were in effect through 2021 and were later lifted in 2022  
   • Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate  
   • Summary: This federal requirement (implemented under a new administration) imposed mask‐wearing rules on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties, primarily for interstate travel. Although this set of actions directly targeted travel rather than local business operations and therefore did not directly impact Camarillo’s brick‐and‐mortar businesses in Q3 2020, it reflected the continued federal response to the pandemic into 2021. The order illustrated the overall regulatory environment that evolved from widespread closures to strategic measures such as mask mandates once vaccines and other measures began changing the landscape of safe operations.

California State Orders

1. State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency  
   • Order Number: Not applicable (Governor’s Proclamation)  
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state emergency remained in effect; ended February 28, 2023)  
   • Rescinded By: A later proclamation ending the emergency in 2023  
   • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 to mobilize additional resources and prepare for wider spread of COVID‑19. This declaration empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue wide‐ranging orders affecting business operations—including closures and restrictions. During Q3 2020, the state emergency status underpinned continued public health actions that kept many non‑essential businesses in Camarillo operating under limited conditions or with staggered openings.

   • (Citation reference: [45†L72-L80])

2. Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effectively immediate)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) which formally terminated the stay‑at‑home order  
   • Summary: This order mandated that all Californians stay at home except for essential needs and allowed only critical infrastructure and essential businesses to remain open. It forced non‑essential businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, theaters, etc.) to either shut down or significantly scale back operations. In Q3 2020, although the direct “stay‐at‐home” order had been adjusted and phased out in some areas to allow reopening, its legacy continued to affect Camarillo businesses through continued capacity limits and operational restrictions derived from the original mandate.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)  
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (linked to EO N‑60‑20)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
   • Summary: As COVID‑19 case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began its Stage 2 reopening. This order relaxed the strict stay‑at‑home conditions to allow lower‑risk businesses—such as curbside pickup retail operations—to resume work while keeping higher‑risk businesses closed. Its easing enabled a cautious reopening in Camarillo during summer; however, the later resurgence of cases led to a rollback in July 2020 that again limited business operations, thereby placing many businesses in a state of flux during Q3 2020.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order announced on August 28, 2020 and later the “Beyond Blueprint” update  
   • Summary: In response to a surge in cases in July 2020, the State re‑imposed restrictions that closed indoor operations across a range of sectors including restaurants (indoor dining), bars, theaters, and personal care. This order had an acute impact on Camarillo businesses during Q3 2020 as previously reopened sectors had to shut indoor operations—forcing many to rely on limited outdoor or take‑out services. It demonstrated how quickly reopening could be reversed during the ongoing pandemic.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System  
   • Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020); effective August 31, 2020  
   • Date Enacted: August 28, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order issued on June 11, 2021  
   • Summary: This framework replaced simple monitoring‑list closures with a graduated, risk-based tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) which determined what indoor or outdoor operations could resume in each county based on local metrics. Ventura County—and therefore Camarillo—entered the Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning most non‑essential indoor operations remained prohibited. As conditions slowly improved, moving into the Red tier in October allowed limited indoor reopening. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, the tier system meant persistent severe restrictions until local indicators improved significantly.

6. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
   • Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced and took effect early December 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: A statewide announcement lifting the regional order when ICU capacity improved  
   • Summary: In December 2020, due to a severe winter surge causing ICU capacity in Southern California to drop below critical levels (below 15% availability), a Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was issued. This order forced the closure of even outdoor dining in some sectors, personal care services, theaters, and more, and while its most acute effects were felt in Q4 2020 and early Q1 2021, its existence underscored the uncertainty throughout 2020. Although Q3 2020 predated this December order, businesses had already been operating under the threat that further restrictions could return at any time.

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
   • Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Public Health Officer Order  
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Not applicable (it ended all previous business restrictions)  
   • Rescinded By: This order itself terminated the earlier orders (but the state of emergency remained in effect)  
   • Summary: This order marked California’s full reopening by formally rescinding the March 2020 Stay‑at‑Home Order and retiring the Blueprint tier system. Although its effect came in mid‑2021, it highlights how long business restrictions continued—from the start of the pandemic until conditions (vaccination rates and case declines) allowed a full reopening. For Q3 2020, this emphasizes that businesses continued to operate under restrictions well beyond the initial shutdown, enduring multiple layers of rules during that quarter.

Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (continued until later, i.e. 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A later resolution by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors (beyond our timeframe)  
   • Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency. This declaration was the basis for all subsequent county health orders including lockdowns and social distancing measures. In Q3 2020, the ongoing emergency status allowed the county to enforce additional restrictions and directives that affected business operations, reinforcing a climate of caution and regulation.

   • Link: (Local county emergency is referenced generally; see sources such as the Ventura County Public Health website)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures and Gathering Restrictions  
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020  
   • Summary: Before the statewide stay‑at‑home mandate, Ventura County issued its own order requiring vulnerable residents to shelter in place and directing the closure of bars, gyms, theaters, and similar venues. Although this order was quickly incorporated into the broader March 20 directive, it set a precedent for aggressive local measures. The rapid escalation of restrictions in Ventura County in March laid the foundation for how local businesses would have to adapt—continuing into Q3 2020 through lingering restrictions and cautious reopening protocols.

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Lockdown  
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Effectively ended June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening)  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: Ventura County’s “Stay Well at Home” order mandated that all residents remain at home except for essential activities, effectively closing most businesses. Although adjusted later to allow for some reopenings with strict protocols, the underlying restrictions continued to affect Camarillo businesses by limiting in‑person services and enforcing capacity limits into Q3 2020. This county order meant that even as state guidelines evolved, the enforcement of lockdown measures on the local level remained a significant burden on business activity during that quarter.

   • Link: (For details, see Ventura County Public Health website or related news such as from ABC7: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close)

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
   • Order Dates: Multiple updates (e.g., March 31, April 9, April 20, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the May 7 “Safely Reopening” order  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s Health Officer Order of May 7, 2020  
   • Summary: Through the spring of 2020, Ventura County updated its initial orders to extend the lockdown and add detailed social distancing requirements. These orders gradually tightened restrictions on gatherings, clarified definitions of essential businesses, and mandated precise safety protocols for those that remained open. Although these specific orders were replaced by the reopening framework in May 2020, their protocols (masking, distancing, capacity limits) carried forward into how businesses in Camarillo operated throughout Q3 2020.

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
   • Order Dates: May 7, 2020 (initial) and May 20, 2020 (amended)  
   • Date Rescinded: Later superseded by the state Blueprint order (effective August 31, 2020) and ultimately by the June 15, 2021 reopening  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County’s update aligning with state guidelines  
   • Summary: As California signaled the start of reopening in May 2020, Ventura County’s “Safely Reopening” order allowed certain lower‑risk businesses to resume operations under strict safety protocols. For instance, curbside pickup for retail was permitted and, later, dine‑in service in restaurants was allowed on a limited basis. For Q3 2020 businesses in Camarillo, these orders meant that although there was a tentative reopening in the summer, many sectors continued to face sudden rollbacks (as in the July 13 order) and instability in operating conditions.

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure  
   • Order Date: June 30, 2020 (effective for July 3–5, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: The order expired on July 6, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: Its own terms (limited-time order)  
   • Summary: In anticipation of mass gatherings during the Independence Day weekend and amid rising case numbers, Ventura County ordered local beaches closed for the holiday weekend. Although Camarillo is an inland community, the order affected nearby coastal tourism and thereby indirectly impacted local businesses that depended on tourist traffic. This specific targeted shutdown was one example of the sporadic and localized restrictions that further complicated the operating environment during Q3 2020.

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 when the county moved to the Red tier  
   • Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated October 6, 2020  
   • Summary: To enforce the statewide rollback of reopenings in July 2020, Ventura County issued a local order that mandated the closure of indoor services for sectors such as gyms, personal care, and places of worship. For businesses in Camarillo, this meant that operations which had reopened in early summer were abruptly curtailed again—resulting in a significant economic hit during Q3 2020. The order remained in force until local COVID‑19 metrics improved enough in October 2020 to allow a partial relaxation of indoor restrictions.

   • Link: (See local Ventura County order details as referenced in [9†L31-L39])

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: This easing was later overridden when winter surges brought additional restrictions; final statewide lifting occurred on June 15, 2021  
   • Rescinded By: The Dec. 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and subsequent changes; ultimately replaced by the “Beyond Blueprint” reopening  
   • Summary: On October 6, 2020, Ventura County’s health officer announced a move into the Red tier, which allowed certain indoor operations (e.g., gyms, houses of worship, personal care services) to reopen at limited capacity. For a Camarillo business operating in late Q3 2020, this signaled the first potential easing of restrictions after months of severe lockdown. However, the improvements were temporary as subsequent surges led to re‑impositions of closures in December 2020.

   • Link: (For details, see Ventura County Health Officer Order dated October 6, 2020 on vcportal.ventura.org)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions  
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and extensions)  
   • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial passed March 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, protections extended through September 30, 2020; for residential tenants, superseded by state law (e.g. AB 3088) from September 1, 2020  
   • Rescinded By: California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential; county Board extensions for commercial eventually expired  
   • Summary: Recognizing the severe economic hardship on businesses and residents, Ventura County imposed an eviction moratorium that delayed evictions for tenants affected by COVID‑19. This measure provided crucial relief for small businesses (as well as residents) by preventing loss of premises due to nonpayment of rent. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses falling behind on rent were under protection, affording them time to adjust their operations without facing sudden eviction—even though the moratorium did not forgive rent due.

City of Camarillo Orders

1. Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation – City Declaration of Emergency  
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Remained in place through 2020–2021 (officially ended in 2022)  
   • Rescinded By: A later City Council resolution in 2022 (beyond this scope)  
   • Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency in response to COVID‑19, activating its Emergency Operations Center. This declaration allowed the city to suspend public events, close city facilities, and coordinate with county and state authorities to protect public health. In Q3 2020, the continuing emergency status meant that Camarillo retained the ability to quickly adjust local regulations—which affected business permits, public gatherings, and overall consumer confidence in local commerce.

   • Link: (See archived Camarillo City Council press releases, e.g., from camhealth.com)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (initial March 18, 2020) and an Amendment (April 23, 2020)  
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, later superseded by state law (AB 3088; effectively from August/September 2020); commercial provisions remained until the local emergency ended  
   • Rescinded By: California’s COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act and later termination of local orders  
   • Summary: The City of Camarillo implemented its own eviction moratorium to protect both residential and commercial tenants from being evicted due to pandemic‑related financial hardships. This was designed to give struggling businesses and residents time to stabilize their incomes during the crisis. For businesses in Q3 2020, this meant that even if revenues were reduced, they were shielded from immediate legal eviction, although the accumulated debt would need to be eventually repaid.

   • Link: (Refer to Camarillo City press releases on evictions, for example: https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
   • Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; adopted in early June 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively when full indoor dining resumed, around June 15, 2021, and later formally ended)  
   • Rescinded By: Sunset when the local emergency concluded and normal zoning resumed  
   • Summary: With indoor dining restricted, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020‑63 to waive usual zoning requirements and permit temporary outdoor dining setups for restaurants. This measure allowed restaurants to serve customers safely outdoors by easing permitting processes and fee requirements. In Q3 2020, this program was a lifeline for dining establishments in Camarillo, enabling them to operate despite restrictions on indoor service and thereby partially softening the economic impact of the pandemic.

     (Also see related Camarillo press releases at camhealth.com)

4. Miscellaneous City Measures (Additional Actions)  
   • Dates: Various in spring to summer 2020  
   • Summary: Beyond emergency proclamations and eviction moratoria, Camarillo also took steps such as suspending late fees on business taxes, transitioning permit and licensing processes online, and launching promotional campaigns to support take‑out dining. These measures were designed to support local businesses during the pandemic by reducing regulatory burdens and financial penalties while ensuring compliance with public health orders. Such supportive actions helped mitigate the economic shock for many Q3 2020 businesses even as they grappled with reduced foot traffic and intermittent closures.

──────────────────────────────
Additional Notes

The research gathered and compiled above explains that during Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo operated under a highly complex and evolving regulatory environment. The federal emergency declaration set the stage for state actions; California’s statewide shutdown and subsequent reopening measures (including the stay‑at‑home orders, stage‑based reopening orders, and the Blueprint description) dictated much of the operational limitations; Ventura County implemented and updated its own set of orders (including local lockdowns, targeted rollbacks in July, and the county’s tier system) which had a direct effect on the region; and the City of Camarillo instituted measures (such as local emergency declarations, eviction moratoriums, and initiatives for outdoor dining) to both enforce public health guidelines and help businesses adapt. For many businesses in Q3 2020, sudden rollbacks (as seen in the July 13 order) meant that reopening was fragile—operations could quickly be curtailed if COVID‑19 case numbers surged. Meanwhile, economic relief measures such as eviction moratoria and streamlined permit processes were essential for survival amid reduced revenue.
