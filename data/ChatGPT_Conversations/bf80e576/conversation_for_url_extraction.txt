COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 [source: bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov  
  https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation]  
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021 [same link])  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state and local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)  
  Summary: Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures, but the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Federal Note:
The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 [source: gov.ca.gov  
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death]  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (for example, suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (such as fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 [source: gov.ca.gov  
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as] (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [source: gov.ca.gov  
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the]  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021. Also superseded by later phased reopening orders.
  Summary: This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to “stay at home” except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors. It forced “non-essential” businesses (such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) either to close or to operate at minimal levels, while “essential” businesses (such as food stores, pharmacies, and banks) could remain open with precautions. By Q3 2020 the direct effects of this March order had evolved – with some sectors gradually reopening in the summer – yet many Camarillo businesses continued to operate under constraints originating from that initial shutdown. For instance, retail shops and restaurants were often limited to outdoor or reduced-capacity operations because the stay-home mandate was still officially in place. The order’s long duration reflected the sustained COVID-19 risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and improving case trends allowed reopening in mid-2021. Its presence in Q3 explains why many businesses remained closed or operated very limited services.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20) [source references included in the original conversation]  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order) [source: cdph.ca.gov  
  https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order]  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), Section 5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order.
  Summary: As COVID-19 case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began “Stage 2” of reopening. In line with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the stringent March stay-home restrictions. This order permitted lower-risk businesses to reopen with modifications – for instance, retail stores such as clothing shops, bookstores, and florists could offer curbside pickup, and the manufacturing/supply chains supporting them could resume operation. However, higher-risk establishments (like dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons) continued to remain closed at this stage. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order was part of a gradual reopening that began in late spring, although many businesses still faced continued or evolving restrictions as the summer surge later forced a rollback.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 [source references included in the original conversation]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021 [source: cdph.ca.gov link provided above]
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) replaced these closures with a tier system; later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions.
  Summary: In July 2020, following a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases, the State Health Officer re-imposed lockdown measures on sectors that had previously reopened. Statewide, the July 13 order mandated the closure of many indoor operations that had been permitted under Stage 2 – for example, restaurants had to cease indoor dining (although outdoor and take-out remained allowed), bars, breweries, and movie theaters were closed, and indoor facilities like museums and zoos were shut down again. Additionally, counties with rapidly worsening outbreaks, including Ventura County, were required to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non-critical offices, personal care services (such as nail salons and tattoo parlors), and malls. This order dealt a major blow in Q3 2020 as Camarillo businesses that had begun to reopen in May/June were forced either to partially or completely close again in July. For instance, many restaurants could offer only outdoor dining or takeout, and gyms and salons were largely shuttered for the remainder of the summer. The rollback was a direct response to the significant increase in COVID-19 spread in California, effectively serving as an “emergency brake.”

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) [source: gov.ca.gov  
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease]  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [source: cdph.ca.gov link above]  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective June 15, 2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system.
  Summary: California’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy, unveiled on August 28, 2020, established a long-term color-coded tier system designed to regulate COVID-19 restrictions based on local risk. Under this framework, each county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial risk, Orange = moderate risk, Yellow = minimal risk) based on public health metrics. Each tier specified rules for business operations; for instance, in the most restrictive Purple tier, many non-essential indoor operations were prohibited, whereas in less restrictive tiers, some indoor operations were permitted with capacity limits. For Ventura County (and thus Camarillo), the county entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on August 31, 2020, when case rates were high. In Q3 2020, this framework meant that even though the blanket closures from July were lifted, most businesses – such as retail stores – could only operate indoors at limited capacity, while sectors like indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed or heavily restricted. The tier system remained in effect until improvements in public health led to its retirement on June 15, 2021, at which point nearly all COVID-19 restrictions on businesses were lifted. This long-term framework illustrates why businesses continued to face limitations through Q3 2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021) [source: gov.ca.gov  
  https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,county%20tier%20system%20will%20end]  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order itself ended prior orders)  
  Rescinded By: This order rescinded the remaining COVID-related business restrictions. Although California’s state of emergency remained in effect, the specific business closure/tier framework was terminated.
  Summary: This pair of orders—Governor’s EO and the corresponding State Health Officer Order—marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. They formally terminated the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order (EO N-33-20) and “retired” the Blueprint tier system across the state. Practically, once these orders took effect, capacity limits, physical distancing requirements, and most other COVID-19 operating restrictions on businesses were removed, permitting Camarillo businesses to generally operate at pre-pandemic levels (aside from any remaining sector-specific guidance). In the context of Q3 2020, this June 2021 milestone underscores how long the replacement restrictions persisted after Q3 and explains why Q3 2020 had such a heavy economic impact on businesses.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 [source: cms7files.revize.com  
  https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=spread%20of%20COVID,and%20local%20public%20health%20officials]  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (the county emergency remained active; it ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, beyond the timeframe)
  Summary: Ventura County’s Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020, in response to COVID-19. Although the declaration did not impose business restrictions in and of itself, it provided the legal basis for issuing further health orders and coordinated emergency actions. With this local emergency in place, Ventura County was enabled to mirror state directives (such as stay-at-home orders) and enforce additional local rules as circumstances worsened. In Q3 2020, this emergency status continued to underpin all subsequent local orders affecting businesses in Camarillo.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020 [source: aagla.org  
  https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this earlier order.
  Summary: Ahead of the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its first local restrictions on March 17, 2020. The order directed vulnerable county residents to shelter in place and mandated the closure of select businesses and public facilities until at least April 2, 2020. In practice, venues such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters, and restaurants (limited to take-out) were shut down. Although short-lived and later incorporated into broader orders, this early proactive step established a pattern of aggressive local measures—one that set expectations for later Q3 enforcement even if the direct provisions were no longer in effect.

  Order Date: March 20, 2020 [source: aagla.org

  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions [source: vcportal.ventura.org, watttieder.com])  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of June 15, 2021, which noted the termination of the Governor’s stay-home mandate and lifted local restrictions.
  Summary: Issued on March 20, 2020, this “Stay Well at Home” order required all Ventura County residents to remain in their residences except for essential purposes and ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and activities. It localised state directives, incorporating county-specific definitions and enforcement mechanisms. As a result, nearly all Camarillo businesses had to suspend in-person operations, except for those deemed essential. Although the order was amended over time to permit partial reopenings, its foundational restrictions continued to influence business operations through Q3 2020. The prolonged duration of these measures was driven by persistent high caseloads in the region.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates:  
    – March 31, 2020: Extended the Stay Well at Home order to April 19, 2020 [source: vcportal.ventura.org  
    https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20March%2031%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,framework%20is%20based%20upon%20the]  
    – April 9, 2020: Added a gathering ban and safety protocols [source: aagla.org

    – April 20, 2020: Further extended the stay-home order through May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond) and fully repealed by the county’s May 7, 2020 order that replaced the April provisions.
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of May 7, 2020, which repealed the April 9 and April 20 orders, replacing them with a “Safely Reopening” order in line with state guidelines.
  Summary: In response to evolving COVID-19 conditions during the early months of the pandemic, Ventura County updated its stay-home order several times. On March 31, 2020, the existing order was extended; on April 9, a ban on gatherings (outside single households) and new social distancing protocols for essential operations were introduced; and on April 20, definitions and requirements were tightened further. Although these orders were later replaced by reopening frameworks, they established new behavioral and operational norms—such as distancing and enhanced safety protocols—that continued to affect Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, influencing customer capacity, operational procedures, and overall economic activity.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020 [sources: aagla.org and portofhueneme.org  
  https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20May%2020%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,A%20Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint order (Aug. 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 state reopening (with local restrictions effectively ending)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order of Aug. 31, 2020 (which aligned the county with the state’s Blueprint Tier 1), and ultimately the state’s June 15, 2021 order ending all tiered restrictions.
  Summary: As the state signaled a cautious reopening in small steps, Ventura County’s Health Officer issued the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order in early May 2020. The initial May 7 order repealed stricter April orders, enabling certain lower-risk businesses to resume operations with controls in place. Then, on May 20, after attaining state approval for an “accelerated Stage 2” reopening, the order was amended to permit dine-in restaurants and in-store retail—with strict precautions. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, these orders represented a crucial window when many establishments could operate (albeit with capacity limits, social distancing, and sanitation requirements) following the total shutdown of earlier months. However, the improvement was short-lived as the summer surge eventually forced renewed restrictions.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020) [source: abc7.com  
  https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County]  
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (the order applied only to the Independence Day weekend and expired automatically after July 5, 2020)
  Rescinded By: The order expired as scheduled.
  Summary: Anticipating that the July 4th weekend would draw large crowds during a time of rising COVID-19 cases, Ventura County’s health officer ordered that beaches be closed and beach parking lots be off-limits for that weekend. Although Camarillo is not directly on the coast, local businesses—especially those benefiting from tourism in nearby coastal areas such as Ventura or Oxnard—likely experienced reduced patronage due to the preemptive closure. This targeted short-term measure exemplifies how even holiday periods in Q3 2020 were subject to sudden regulatory restrictions intended to mitigate COVID-19 spread.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) [source: vcportal.ventura.org  
  https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby]  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved to Tier 2)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order dated Oct. 6, 2020 allowed certain indoor operations to resume (rescinding parts of the July order).
  Summary: In response to Governor Newsom’s statewide rollback on July 13, 2020, Ventura County issued a local order that effectively re-closed indoor operations for several sectors (e.g., gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, personal care services) in line with state directives. For businesses in Camarillo, this meant that those establishments which might have briefly reopened in June were forced to shut down indoor operations again in July. While some businesses were permitted to operate outdoors, venues that could not easily transition suffered a second round of severe limitations. This order is a concrete example of the renewed restrictions that made Q3 2020 so challenging for many local businesses.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020 [source: vcportal.ventura.org  
  https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health]  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (superseded by the December 2020 Regional Stay-At-Home Order and then by a return to the Purple tier in January 2021; ultimately, all local orders were nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening)
  Rescinded By: Effectively replaced by subsequent orders once Ventura County’s COVID metrics improved.
  Summary: By October 6, 2020, improving COVID-19 data allowed Ventura County to transition from the most restrictive Purple tier to the less restrictive Red tier as part of California’s Blueprint framework. The Oct. 6 order eased many of the severe restrictions, permitting certain indoor operations (such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services) to reopen at limited capacity under strict protocols. For businesses in Camarillo that had been operating under the heavy constraints of the summer closure orders, this represented the first tangible relief. However, the easing was relatively short-lived against the backdrop of continuing COVID fluctuations.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (plus subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020) [source: vcportal.ventura.org  
  https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20May%2012%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,A%20Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form]  
  Date Rescinded: September 30, 2020 for commercial evictions; for residential, replaced by state law (AB 3088) effective from Sept 1, 2020  
  Rescinded By: For residential, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; commercially, the county’s extension expired on Sept. 30, 2020 (with later state adjustments allowing some commercial bans through March 2021, though Ventura did not extend further per available records).
  Summary: In recognition of the financial hardships imposed by the pandemic, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors adopted Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 to temporarily ban evictions for tenants (both residential and small-business commercial) who were unable to pay rent due to COVID-19. This measure provided local businesses—such as a small shop owner renting space in an unincorporated area—a crucial breathing space, allowing them to defer rent payments without facing immediate eviction. Although such deferrals did not absolve rent obligations, they prevented a rush of evictions during a period when revenue was dramatically reduced due to COVID restrictions. This protection was extremely important in Q3 2020 as many businesses were still struggling to recover from earlier losses.

  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the local emergency remained in effect into 2021; formally ended in April 2022, outside our timeframe)
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022)
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19. City Manager Dave Norman (as EOC Director) issued Order No. 20-1, which the City Council promptly ratified. This declaration activated Camarillo’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed the city to mobilize emergency responses—including the closure of city facilities and cancellation of public events—that also indirectly affected local businesses. In Q3 2020, the local emergency was still on the books, giving Camarillo additional authority to enact or enforce public health measures that could affect business operations (for example, outdoor dining regulations or permitting adjustments).

  Rescinded By: Residential protections were preempted by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; commercial provisions ended with the local emergency resolution in 2022.
  Summary: To prevent a rush of evictions amid COVID-19-induced financial hardship, Camarillo issued a citywide moratorium (Order No. 20-2) on evictions for both residential and commercial tenants. This order temporarily halted evictions for businesses that were unable to pay rent due to reduced income during the pandemic. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, the moratorium offered critical relief by protecting them from the immediate threat of eviction, even though rent obligations would later be due.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the local emergency duration)  
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset when the local COVID emergency ended and normal zoning rules were restored in 2021/2022.
  Summary: To help restaurants maintain operations despite indoor dining closures, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution No. 2020-63 in early June 2020. This measure waived certain zoning fees and relaxed parking and clearance requirements to allow restaurants to create temporary outdoor dining spaces (e.g., using parking lots, sidewalks, or other open areas). In Q3 2020, when statewide orders again forced the closure of indoor dining, these outdoor dining programs enabled restaurants to continue serving customers and mitigate revenue losses. The initiative provided a lifeline for dining establishments by allowing them to partially recoup lost income while complying with social distancing guidelines.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring–summer)
  Summary: Beyond the major orders described above, the City of Camarillo implemented several additional measures to support local businesses during COVID-19. For example, the city suspended late fees for business taxes, moved permit processes online to minimize in-person contact, and promoted take-out dining as an alternative to indoor service. While these actions were not “orders” in the traditional sense, they formed part of the comprehensive local response to COVID-19—and had tangible impacts on business operations throughout Q3 2020.

Overall Analysis for Q3 2020 Business Impact

Across federal, state, county, and city levels, the patchwork of COVID-19 orders created an environment in Q3 2020 where businesses in Camarillo faced significant and evolving restrictions. Even as some sectors began to reopen on a limited basis (often only outdoors or at reduced capacity), the lingering effects of strict stay-home orders and subsequent rollback measures (such as the July 13 state order and county reclosures) meant that many businesses continued to operate under severe limitations during Q3. In addition, ancillary measures like eviction moratoriums and outdoor dining resolutions mitigated some economic damage, but overall the sustained uncertainty and regulatory flux led to persistent challenges for Camarillo’s local economy during that quarter.
