Form 886-A – Employee Retention Credit (ERC) Substantiation  
Date: 3/31/2025

1. Issue  
• The disallowance of the ERC claim was based on the assertion that "no government orders were in effect."  
• This protest is based solely on the government orders approach, asserting that multiple federal, state, county, and municipal orders in effect during Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 directly imposed full or partial suspension of operations for West Coast Marble and Granite.  
• The evidence below demonstrates that government orders – which restricted access, reduced business capacity, and altered operating protocols – were active and materially impacted the business during the relevant periods.

2. Facts  
• Business Overview: West Coast Marble and Granite is a Camarillo, CA–based business engaged in the fabrication, supply, and installation of high‐quality marble and granite products. The company provides custom countertops, vanities, flooring, and wall cladding for both residential and commercial projects.  
• Operations & Workflow: The business designs custom stone surfaces at its fabrication facility, sources raw stone from suppliers, and executes on‐site installations. Workflows involve precision cutting, templating, polishing processes, and customer consultations to ensure exact design and fit. The firm typically serves local contractors, upscale residential homeowners, and commercial establishments in the greater Ventura County region.  
• Industry Context: In a community like Camarillo, where high-end residential and commercial construction projects are common, the company’s operations are subject to both material supply chain constraints and scheduling of on‐site installations. During Q2 and Q3 2020, the cascade of COVID-19 orders disrupted normal operations by limiting access to supply channels, shortening on-site work windows due to social distancing mandates, and reducing customer visits or consultations.  
• COVID-19 Impact: The activation of federal national emergency declarations, state stay-at-home and reopening rollback orders, and local Camarillo emergency proclamations forced a partial suspension of West Coast Marble and Granite’s operations. In Q2 2020, the business experienced reduced throughput owing to closures and modified work practices mandated by government orders. In Q3 2020, renewed restrictions and phased reopening protocols further constrained the ability to perform full-scale fabrication and installation services, thereby directly impacting business operations.

3. Law  
• Under the CARES Act, the subsequent Coronavirus Response and Relief Act, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP), eligible employers can claim the ERC if their business operations were fully or partially suspended due to governmental orders limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings.  
• IRS Notice 2021-20, IRS Notice 2021-23, and IRS Notice 2021-49 clearly state that even if only part of the business was affected, the credit may be available provided the government orders imposed a “more than nominal” reduction – often quantified under the “10% rule.”  
• The legal test for “full or partial suspension” requires a review of the specific operational limitations imposed by the order. In this case, West Coast Marble and Granite was forced to modify or halt portions of its operations (such as on-site installations and in-facility fabrications), satisfying the requisite legal standard for a “more than nominal” impact.  
• The analysis further confirms that even if the business is considered an essential service, the imposed restrictions on customer interactions, capacity limits, and supply chain interruptions constitute a valid basis for partial suspension under the applicable provisions.

4. Argument  
Below are the detailed government orders that were in effect during the claimed periods:

Q2 2020 Orders

  • Order Number: N-33-20

The order stipulated that only essential services could remain open while enforcing social distancing measures.”  
  • Impact on Quarter: As a direct result of this order, West Coast Marble and Granite experienced reduced foot traffic and delayed on-site consultations, leading to a partial suspension of its customary fabrication and installation workflow during Q2 2020.

• Order Name: Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1

5. Conclusion  
• In light of the comprehensive evidence provided above, West Coast Marble and Granite meets the criteria for the ERC based solely on the government orders approach.
