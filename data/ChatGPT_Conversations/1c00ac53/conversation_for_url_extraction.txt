COVID-19 Orders Business Impact

The following is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‐related orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses operating in Camarillo, California. For each order the report includes:
– The order number or identifying number (when provided)
– The name or title of the government order/proclamation
– The date it was enacted and the date it was rescinded (or note if not rescinded during 2020–2021)

– A detailed summary (usually 3–5 sentences) describing what the order entailed and how it affected a business in Q3 2020, including possible reasons why businesses would be affected in that quarter.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect and was later terminated by Congress in 2023)  
  – Rescinded by: A later congressional termination (beyond 2020–2021 scope)  
  – Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding and set the stage for subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. Although it did not in itself mandate business closures, the declaration underpinned the authority for severe public health measures. In Q3 2020, while federal direct restrictions on private business operations were not imposed, the persistence of the national emergency provided the justification for state/local measures that affected business operations in Camarillo.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  – Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (with related CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Remained in effect through 2021 (later lifted by court order in April 2022)  
  – Rescinded by: A court order (April 18, 2022)  
  – Summary: With the onset of a new administration in early 2021, federal mask mandates for travel (airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties) were introduced via an executive order and CDC directive. These orders did not directly close businesses but applied to travel and related sectors. Although the mandates began after Q3 2020, they illustrate the evolving federal response to COVID‑19 that later affected travel‐related business operations.
  – Note: While federal restrictions set the overall emergency context, the primary restrictions for Camarillo businesses in 2020 were imposed by state and local orders.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency  
  – Order Number: Not applicable (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  – Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active through that period)  
  – Rescinded by: Ended on February 28, 2023 by the Governor’s proclamation (outside our timeframe)  
  – Summary: On March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California in response to the rising COVID‑19 crisis. This proclamation provided the legal authority and resources for emergency actions—including imposing restrictions and later lockdown measures—that would affect business operations. In Q3 2020, with the emergency still in place, businesses operated under directives justified by this proclamation, receiving both regulatory relief and restrictions.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
  – Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (Effective immediately)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded by: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) which terminated the stay‑at‑home phase  
  – Summary: This order directed all residents in California to remain at home except for essential needs. It forced the closure of “non‑essential” businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) and permitted only essential operations. Even though by Q3 2020 some sectors had begun to reopen under modified rules, many businesses still faced significant limitations rooted in this original order; many could only operate under strictly reduced capacity due to its lingering framework.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay‑at‑Home for Early Stage 2  
  – Order Date: May 7, 2020 (issued under Executive Order N‑60‑20)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded by: The “Beyond Blueprint” order, issued on June 11, 2021, which formally ended the tier framework  
  – Summary: As the initial peak passed, California began “Stage 2” reopening wherein lower‑risk businesses (such as many retail stores) were allowed to reopen with modifications (for example, curbside pickup). However, higher‑risk venues like dine‑in restaurants still had to remain closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this order was key to the gradual reopening that allowed some operations to resume in summer, even though many sectors quickly faced renewed closures when COVID‑19 cases surged again in July.
  – Link: Refer to state health officer documents and state guidance describing Stage 2 orders.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the adoption of the Blueprint tier system; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  – Rescinded by: The State Public Health Officer’s “Blueprint” order (effective August 28–31, 2020)  
  – Summary: In response to a sharp surge in COVID‑19 cases in July 2020, the state re‑imposed stricter measures that closed many indoor operations which had been reopened in Stage 2. This order meant that businesses such as indoor dining restaurants, bars, gyms, and personal care services in Camarillo were forced to shut down again or limit operations to outdoor-only or takeout formats throughout much of Q3 2020.
  – Link: See state press releases and official orders from July 2020 for details.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” – Color‑Tier Reopening Framework  
  – Order Number: (State Public Health Officer Order issued on August 28, 2020)  
  – Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced effective August 31, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (when the “Beyond Blueprint” order ended all tier restrictions)  
  – Rescinded by: The June 15, 2021 “Beyond Blueprint” order  
  – Summary: California replaced earlier blanket restrictions with a color‑coded risk‑based tier system that assigned counties to Purple (most restrictive) through Yellow (least restrictive) tiers. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, initially remained in the most restrictive (Purple) tier in late August 2020. This meant that even though the statewide “shutdown” was eased somewhat, many Camarillo businesses (for example, indoor operations for restaurants and gyms) could only operate under very limited conditions during the latter part of Q3 2020. When conditions improved, Ventura County transitioned to a slightly less restrictive tier (Red) in October.

• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order (ICU Capacity Trigger Shutdown)  
  – Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced, effective from December 6, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  – Rescinded by: The lifting of the order upon improved ICU projections statewide  
  – Summary: Although this order was issued in December 2020, it is included in the context as it underscored the ongoing risk environment even after Q3. It mandated that if ICU capacity dropped below 15% availability, regions would be forced into a full stay‑at‑home lockdown. For businesses in Camarillo, while the Regional Order did not directly apply in Q3 2020, its later imposition in winter reinforced the uncertainty and the close link between public health metrics and business operations.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
  – Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Health Officer Order  
  – Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  – Date Rescinded: Not applicable (this order itself ended the previous restrictions)  
  – Summary: This order signaled the full reopening of California, formally terminating the earlier stay‑at‑home orders and retiring the Blueprint tier system. Although it came after Q3 2020, it highlights that until mid‑2021, business restrictions (including in Q3 2020) continued in effect due to inadequate health markers. Camarillo businesses that had to operate at reduced capacity in Q3 2020 could resume normal operations after this order.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  – Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect until formally ended in 2022)  
  – Rescinded by: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution in 2022  
  – Summary: On March 12, 2020, the county’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency. While the emergency declaration by itself did not mandate closures, it empowered the county to issue rapid local orders and enforce state directives. In Q3 2020, this maintained the legal framework for ongoing restrictions in Ventura County (and therefore in Camarillo).
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures & Gathering Restrictions  
  – Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order  
  – Rescinded by: The March 20, 2020 order issued by the Ventura County Health Officer  
  – Summary: Even before the statewide order, Ventura County ordered early closures for bars, gyms, theaters, and other venues. Although quickly integrated into a broader stay‑home directive, this early measure set the tone for aggressive local action. Its early adoption reflected the county’s proactive stance—a stance that continued in various forms through Q3 2020.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay‑Home Order  
  – Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening; formally ended June 15, 2021)  
  – Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update  
  – Summary: This local order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential activities. It resulted in the near‑total shutdown of in‑person business operations except for those deemed essential. In Q3 2020 many restrictions remained in force (albeit in modified form) due to the lingering impact of this order.
  
• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions & Social Distancing Protocols  
  – Order Dates: March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: These were later repealed by a May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order  
  – Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order, May 7, 2020  
  – Summary: The county updated its stay‑home orders multiple times in spring 2020 to extend the duration of the lockdown and introduce strict gathering bans and safety protocols for remaining open businesses. Although these particular orders were superseded, their guidelines on distancing and limiting contact carried into the reopening measures that affected Q3 2020 operations.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 Reopening  
  – Order Dates: May 7, 2020; amended May 20, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint order on August 31, 2020 and later ended by the June 15, 2021 full reopening  
  – Rescinded by: The Ventura County Health Officer’s later orders aligning with the state system  
  – Summary: In early May 2020, Ventura County transitioned from hard shutdown orders toward a staged reopening. The May 7 order allowed lower‑risk businesses (retail, logistic operations) to resume under safety protocols; the May 20 amendment further permitted dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail under strict conditions. This order determined which Camarillo businesses could reopen during summer, even though many later faced renewed restrictions (as seen in the July 13 rollback).

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure  
  – Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
  – Date Rescinded: Automatically expired July 6, 2020  
  – Summary: To prevent mass gatherings over the Independence Day weekend, health officials ordered the closure of beaches and beach parking lots. Although Camarillo is inland, neighboring coastal areas (within Ventura County) saw significant drops in tourism and related business activity during this period, affecting regional economic conditions.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  – Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (as the county moved into a less restrictive tier)  
  – Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  – Summary: Following the statewide rollback, Ventura County enforced the closure of additional indoor operations (gyms, churches, personal care services) even for businesses that had just begun operations in June. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that many venues had to shut down or drastically curtail indoor operations through the summer.
  
• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  – Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (when the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was later imposed in December 2020, and then reverted on returning to a more restrictive tier in January 2021)  
  – Summary: As local conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier, permitting indoor reopening for certain business types (gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services) subject to safety protocols. This provided a brief reprieve at the end of Q3 2020 (and into early Q4) but was later countermanded by renewed restrictions.
  – Link: See Ventura County official health pages and corresponding PDFs.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions  
  – Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  – Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020 (for residential, later replaced by state law from September 1, 2020 via AB 3088)  
  – Rescinded by: California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) and later county decisions  
  – Summary: In an effort to protect tenants from eviction due to COVID‑related income losses, Ventura County imposed a temporary moratorium on evictions. This included both residential and commercial tenants (small businesses renting storefronts in the county) and helped many Camarillo businesses avoid immediate closure due to lease defaults. Although it merely postponed rent obligations rather than forgiving them, it provided essential economic relief in a quarter of severe revenue loss.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  – Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36)  
  – Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  – Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (local emergency remained active; formally ended in 2022)  
  – Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency to mobilize resources and enable rapid response. Under this declaration, city facilities were closed and public events cancelled. The emergency status also allowed for the prompt issuance of additional measures (such as outdoor dining programs and streamlined permitting) that later affected how Camarillo businesses operated in Q3 2020.
  
• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  – Order Numbers: Initially issued as EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 on March 18, 2020 and amended on April 23, 2020  
  – Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law protections (residential tenants from August 31, 2020) and ended with the local emergency later  
  – Summary: To protect both residential and commercial tenants facing income losses due to the pandemic, Camarillo implemented its own eviction moratorium. This measure helped local small businesses renting space avoid eviction during the lean months. Such protection provided critical breathing room in Q3 2020 amid ongoing restrictions on normal business activities.
  
• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  – Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  – Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively around June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed)  
  – Rescinded by: Sunset as local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated  
  – Summary: Recognizing that many restaurants could not operate dine‑in services under strict indoor capacity limits, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020‑63 to waive certain zoning requirements and fees for temporary outdoor dining areas. This allowed restaurants to quickly set up outdoor seating (on sidewalks, parking lots, etc.) and maintain some revenue during the pandemic restrictions in Q3 2020.
  – Link: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020...

• Miscellaneous City Measures  
  – Dates: Various during spring–summer 2020  
  – Summary: In addition to the primary orders listed, Camarillo took several supportive actions such as suspending late fees on business taxes, moving permit processes online, and promoting take‑out dining initiatives. These administrative measures and supportive campaigns complemented the restrictions and relief orders and helped local businesses adjust to the new operating environment in Q3 2020.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Overall Analysis (Focused on Q3 2020 Impact):

Businesses operating in Camarillo in the third quarter of 2020 had to navigate a patchwork of continued emergency declarations and evolving restrictions. Although some easing measures in May allowed low‑risk businesses to reopen, the rapid surge in COVID‑19 cases during the summer led to renewed rollbacks in July. The strict stay‑at‑home orders, ongoing tier systems established in the state’s Blueprint framework, and local rollback orders together meant that many businesses experienced:
  • Reduced operating capacities (often only outdoor or take‑out operations were permitted)  
  • Frequent and sudden shifts between opening and closure  
  • Financial pressures exacerbated by temporary eviction moratoria and deferred rent obligations  
  • A need to rapidly adapt to new safety protocols (social distancing, masking, sanitation measures)  

The cumulative effect was a highly challenging business environment in Q3 2020, where operators had to balance public health restrictions with efforts to salvage revenue during a period of uncertain, rapidly changing regulatory conditions.
