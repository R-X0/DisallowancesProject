COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

 Federal Orders

1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President until later action)  
   • Rescinded by: Congress terminated the national emergency later (outside this timeframe)  
   • Summary: On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak. Although this proclamation did not close businesses directly, it activated federal emergency powers and funding that underpinned subsequent state‐ and local-level orders. In Q3 2020, even though local orders did the heavy lifting for business restrictions, the ongoing national emergency provided the umbrella justification for stricter public health measures. It indirectly influenced business operations by setting a tone of urgency and providing access to federal stimulus aid.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates for Travel  
   • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (via Executive Order 13998 and CDC guidance effective February 1, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: Remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022 by a court order  
   • Summary: Under the new administration, federal mask mandates were introduced to require mask use on airplanes, trains, buses, and at airports. While these mandates were directed at travel-related activities and federal properties rather than directly at private businesses, they underscored the continued federal response to COVID-19. Although not impacting Q3 2020 directly (since this order began in early 2021), its existence highlights the layered nature of COVID-19 public health rules as the crisis continued into 2021.
   • Source Note: This mandate was part of the federal response and is noted for context as federal action provided guidance even though state and local orders primarily affected business operations in Q3 2020.

───────────────────────────── 
 California State Orders

1. California State of Emergency (Governor’s Proclamation)  
   • Order Number: N/A (an executive proclamation)  
   • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active; formally ended in February 2023)  
   • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 in response to COVID-19. This emergency designation empowered the governor and state agencies to issue sweeping orders, including business closures and health directives. During Q3 2020, the state of emergency provided the legal foundation for all subsequent COVID orders and kept businesses under restrictive measures. It also enabled access to state aid and regulatory adjustments that businesses relied upon in a time of crisis.

2. Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
   • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (rescinded by Executive Order N-07-21 signed June 11, 2021)  
   • Summary: On March 19, 2020, California issued a statewide stay-at-home order requiring all residents to remain at their homes except for essential activities. This order forced the closure of non-essential businesses such as dine-in restaurants, gyms, retail stores, and theaters, which drastically affected business revenues across the state including in Camarillo. Although by Q3 2020 the order had been modified with gradual reopenings, its legacy meant that many business operations had only slowly resumed and were still under tight capacity limits and safety protocols. The order’s continuation until better conditions emerged explains the extensive restrictions imposed on businesses during Q3 2020.

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 – Early Reopening)  
   • Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued per EO N-60-20)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
   • Summary: As conditions in the spring of 2020 allowed for some reopening, California’s Stage 2 order permitted lower-risk sectors (such as curbside retail, some manufacturing, and outdoor services) to resume operations with modifications. In Camarillo, this allowed some retailers and service providers to reopen with safety measures in place for a brief period. However, because COVID case numbers surged again in the summer of 2020, many of these reopenings were short-lived. The order represents the first step toward economic normalization while still enforcing substantial restrictions that impacted customer capacity and service models in Q3 2020.
   • Source Note: Detailed state documents referenced include the Resilience Roadmap and public health officer’s orders available from the California Department of Public Health.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Rollback of Reopening  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Effectively replaced on August 31, 2020 by the “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” tier framework; formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: In response to a significant surge in COVID-19 cases during the summer, California reimposed restrictions on indoor operations for several business sectors such as restaurants, movie theaters, gyms, and personal care services. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that establishments which had partially reopened in May and early June were forced to close indoor operations again in July 2020, severely affecting revenue. The rollback was intended to curb the virus spread at a time when public health conditions worsened, even as some outdoor or takeout services were allowed.
   • Source Link: Referenced within state documents and summarized from official state announcements.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” (August 28, 2020) – Tier Reopening Framework  
   • Order Number: State Health Officer Order (announced August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
   • Summary: This framework introduced a color-coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on county infection metrics. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, was initially placed in the most restrictive Purple tier at the start of the framework, meaning that many indoor operations remained closed while some businesses were permitted to open at very limited capacity. The Blueprint system allowed for gradual reopening when conditions improved; however, for much of Q3 2020, restrictions were still severe. The tier system provided a predictable set of criteria for both closing and reopening, even though in practice it meant that businesses faced ongoing operational limitations during the summer.

6. Regional Stay-at-Home Order (ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown)  
   • Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in the SoCal region on December 6, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
   • Summary: As COVID-19 cases spiked during the winter surge, California implemented a Regional Stay-at-Home Order based on ICU capacity thresholds. Although the order was in effect in late 2020 and early 2021, its existence was a reminder during Q3 2020 that the threat of renewed shutdowns was very real. It mandated the closure of numerous business sectors (including the elimination of outdoor dining for restaurants and shuttering of personal care services) in parts of Southern California. While its direct effect was in Q4 2020, many Camarillo businesses were still operating under cautious expectations in Q3 2020, knowing a further rollback could occur.

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Full Reopening  
   • Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order  
   • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
   • Date Rescinded: This order did not “rescind” restrictions—it ended previous business closures and tiered limitations.  
   • Summary: This pair of orders ended the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order as well as the subsequent tier framework and all remaining business restrictions. For Camarillo, this marked the point when most businesses could finally operate at near-normal capacity. In retrospect, the fact that full reopening was delayed until mid-2021 highlights how prolonged and disruptive the restrictions were—in Q3 2020, businesses were still grappling with mixed signals and evolving capacity limits.

 Ventura County Orders

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
   • Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active until later, ending in 2022)  
   • Summary: Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. Although the declaration itself did not impose direct restrictions on business operations, it provided the legal authority for later orders (such as closures and capacity limits). In Q3 2020, the ongoing emergency status meant that the county retained the authority to adjust and enforce public health measures that affected businesses statewide.
   • Source Link: (Local county emergency proclamations can be found on Ventura County official websites.)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Early Local Restrictions  
   • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order and later repealed by subsequent orders  
   • Summary: Before the statewide lockdown, Ventura County issued an order directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and closing certain businesses and public facilities. Even though it was short-lived and merged into a broader order on March 20, it set a precedent for rapid, local action. Its early aggressive approach underscored the county’s readiness to enforce restrictions, a stance that influenced business operations well into Q3 even if the exact language had evolved.
   • Source Link: (Refer to Ventura County Public Health documents posted at https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)  
   • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (formally lifted with the state reopening)  
   • Summary: This order, the Ventura County complement to the state’s stay-at-home directive, required all residents to remain at home except for essential needs. For businesses in Camarillo, this meant that non-essential stores and services were closed, significantly impacting in-person operations. Although modified over time to allow gradual reopening, its core provisions continued to influence operating practices (like capacity limits and safety protocols) well into Q3 2020.

4. Ventura County Order Updates (March–April 2020)  
   • Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Later replaced by the “Safely Reopening” orders in May 2020  
   • Summary: During the spring, Ventura County periodically updated its “Stay Well at Home” order by extending its duration, banning all gatherings, and imposing social distancing protocols. Although these specific orders were replaced in May as part of the reopening process, the safety measures they introduced (masking, distancing, and prohibition of large gatherings) carried forward into Q3 2020. This continuity influenced how businesses reopened and how many maintained strict safety protocols.
   • Source Link: (These orders appear in Ventura County Health Officer Order documents archived on the county website.)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order (May 2020)  
   • Order Dates: May 7, 2020; amended May 20, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint order on August 31, 2020 and by June 15, 2021 reopening  
   • Summary: As the state and county began to permit limited reopening of lower-risk sectors, Ventura County’s order allowed certain businesses (including curbside retail and manufacturing supporting them) to reopen under strict conditions. In Camarillo, this meant that many businesses tentatively resumed operations with safety requirements in place. However, due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, many restrictions were later reimposed in July 2020, so Q3 saw a yo-yo effect of partial reopening and rollback.

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order  
   • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5 weekend  
   • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired after July 5, 2020  
   • Summary: Anticipating that the popular Independence Day weekend could lead to dangerous gatherings, the county ordered that beaches and beach parking lots be closed for that weekend. While Camarillo is inland, nearby tourism and coastal activities affected by this order had a knock-on effect on local businesses. It exemplified how local authorities sometimes implemented targeted, short-term closures to prevent spikes in infection.

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
   • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 when the county moved into the Red tier  
   • Summary: In line with the state’s renewed restrictions in July, Ventura County issued an order closing indoor operations for non-essential sectors such as gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care services. For Camarillo businesses, this meant another wave of closures for those industries which had briefly reopened earlier in the summer. Although some sectors were later allowed indoor operations once conditions improved, the mid-summer rollback significantly disrupted business continuity in Q3 2020.
   • Source Link:  
     (Details can be found in Ventura County Health Officer orders on the county’s official website.)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order (October 6, 2020)  
   • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Later affected by December 2020 Regional Order and subsequent state changes; ultimately all restrictions were lifted June 15, 2021  
   • Summary: When Ventura County’s public health data improved sufficiently for the county to be placed in the Red tier, the local order allowed indoor operations for certain sectors such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services subject to strict capacity measures. Though coming at the very end of Q3 (or just after it), this order was the first sign of easing restrictions after a tough summer. Its gradual approach provided hope to businesses while also emphasizing that reopening was conditional on sustained improvements.
   • Source Link:  
     (For exact tier details and dates, refer to the Ventura County Health Officer orders available at the county website.)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium (Urgency Ordinance No. 4563)  
   • Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563  
   • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; for residential, later superseded by California AB 3088 (effective September 2020)  
   • Summary: To shield both residents and small local businesses from the immediate financial fallout of the pandemic, Ventura County enacted an eviction moratorium that prevented evictions for nonpayment of rent due to COVID-19 hardships. This measure was critical for many Camarillo businesses that, due to reduced revenues during prolonged lockdowns, could not pay rent on time. Although it did not forgive rent owed, it postponed eviction proceedings so that businesses had time to adapt to the ongoing restrictions.

     (Details of the ordinance and its extensions are available from local county records and from industry groups such as the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles at https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19)

───────────────────────────── 
 City of Camarillo Orders

1. Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation  
   • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
   • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (local emergency remained in effect into 2021; lifted in 2022)  
   • Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19. With this proclamation, the Camarillo Emergency Operations Center was activated and the city was able to immediately implement various emergency measures. The local emergency enabled the city to suspend public events and to later support measures that both restricted certain activities and provided relief (such as streamlined permitting for outdoor dining). It reinforced the overall public health messaging that influenced consumer behavior and business operations in Q3 2020.
   • Source Link:  
     (Local city proclamations and related city council resolutions are available on Camarillo’s official websites and local news archives, for example at https://www.camhealth.com/)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders  
   • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) with an amendment on April 23, 2020  
   • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)  
   • Date Rescinded: Later superseded by state law (AB 3088 for residential evictions effective September 2020) and eventually ended when the local emergency was terminated  
   • Summary: In order to protect local tenants – both residential and commercial – Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium early in the pandemic. This order prevented landlords within the city from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent directly attributable to the COVID-19 crisis. For Camarillo businesses struggling with revenue losses during the pandemic, this measure provided temporary relief from potential eviction, allowing them to focus on recovery efforts rather than immediate lease termination.

     (For complete documentation, see Camarillo City documents such as those at https://www.camhealth.com/city-of-camarillo-past-press-releases and similar archives.)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
   • Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
   • Date Rescinded: Effectively ended when COVID capacity restrictions ended (around June 15, 2021), and later formally discontinued when normal zoning was reinstated  
   • Summary: Recognizing that indoor dining was still heavily restricted by state and county orders, the City of Camarillo passed Resolution No. 2020-63 to allow restaurants to create temporary outdoor dining areas. This measure waived certain zoning fees and allowed restaurants to use parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces to serve customers safely. As a result, many restaurants in Camarillo were able to operate in Q3 2020—albeit at reduced capacity—thus mitigating revenue losses during prolonged indoor closures.

4. Miscellaneous City Measures  
   • Dates: Various in 2020 (spring through summer)  
   • Summary: In addition to the above orders, Camarillo implemented several supportive measures. The city suspended late fees for business taxes, expedited and moved permit processes online to avoid in-person contact, and promoted take-out and outdoor dining campaigns to help local restaurants adapt to operating under COVID conditions. These measures, while not “orders” in the strict regulatory sense, contributed significantly to the overall environment in which Camarillo businesses operated during Q3 2020.
   • Source Note: These actions were announced via city press releases and documented on Camarillo city websites.

Overall Summary of Impact in Q3 2020:

For businesses in Camarillo during the third quarter of 2020 the following factors played a role:
– The lingering state and county orders (stemming from the March lockdown and subsequent partial reopenings) meant many operations (especially indoor activities) remained either closed or constrained.
– Repeated cycles of easing (as seen in the Stage 2 “Safely Reopening” orders) followed by abrupt rollbacks (as in the July 13 state order) forced a “yo-yo” effect on business operations.
– Local initiatives such as Camarillo’s outdoor dining resolution helped mitigate some losses, yet the overall uncertainty led to reduced customer traffic and revenue.
– The backdrop of a prolonged state of emergency at all levels created both legal authority for restrictive orders and provided channels for relief—but also prolonged economic disruption.
– Although full reopening did not occur until June 2021, Q3 2020 was marked by a careful yet disruptive balance between public health protection and economic activity, making it a uniquely challenging quarter for businesses.
