3. Law  
The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is available to businesses whose operations were fully or partially suspended during a calendar quarter as a result of government orders related to COVID‑19. Under IRS Notice 2021‑20 and other related guidance, a “partial suspension” can be established if government directives directly limit the safe and normal operation of a business. Eligibility for the ERC is determined on a quarter-by-quarter basis and takes into account the degree and duration of operational restrictions imposed by official orders.

────────────────────────────────────────────  
4. Argument  
Based on the documented orders:  
• “df” was subjected to a series of federal, state, county, and city orders—most notably the Statewide Stay-at-Home Order (Executive Order N-33-20) and the Ventura County Stay Well at Home Order—that mandated a full or partial shutdown of non-essential business operations during Q2 2020.  
• The Stage 2 Reopening Order provided a framework for limited operations; however, persistent capacity and social distancing restrictions continued to impede normal business functions.  
• Local measures, including the Camarillo Local Emergency Proclamation and the Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Order, further contributed to operational challenges and financial uncertainty by reducing customer traffic and safeguarding business occupancy despite declining revenues.  
• In light of these cumulative effects, “df” has established that its regular business operations were significantly and adversely impacted, thereby meeting the criteria for a partial suspension as required for ERC eligibility under the relevant IRS guidance.

────────────────────────────────────────────  
5. Conclusion  
Based on the reviewed facts, pertinent regulatory orders, and applicable IRS guidance including Notice 2021‑20, the business “df” qualifies for the Employee Retention Credit for Q2 2020. The combination of enforced shutdowns, limited reopening measures, and local emergency directives resulted in a partial suspension of normal business operations. Consequently, “df” is eligible to claim the ERC for the affected quarter.
