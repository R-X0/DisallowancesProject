COVID Orders Business Impact

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 [Source: “【43†L106-L115】”]  
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021 [Source: “【43†L106-L115】”])  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  

  Summary:
  This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)

  Summary:
  Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures, but the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Note on Federal action:
The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 [Source: “【45†L72-L80】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)

  Summary:
  Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (e.g. suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (like fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 [Source: “【47†L31-L39】”] (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [Source: “【58†L1-L4】”]  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021. It was also superseded by later phased reopening orders.

  Summary:
  This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to stay at home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors. It forced “non‐essential” businesses (like dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or shift to minimum basic operations, while “essential” businesses (food stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) could remain open with precautions. In Q3 2020, the direct effects of this March order had evolved – by that summer, California was gradually reopening some sectors – but many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints that stemmed from this original shutdown. For example, retail shops and restaurants in Q3 2020 were allowed only limited operations (outdoor or reduced capacity) because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay-home mandate. The order’s continuation (it was in force “until further notice”) reflected the sustained risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and case trends improved by mid-2021. The presence of this order (and its modifying successors) in Q3 2020 meant businesses were still far from normal – it explains why, that quarter, many Camarillo businesses were either closed or severely limited in service.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20) [Source: “【18†L39-L47】”]  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [Source: “【22†L407-L414】”] (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order)  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), §5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order.

  Summary:
  As COVID case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began “Stage 2” of reopening. Consistent with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the March stay-home restrictions. It allowed lower-risk businesses to reopen with modifications: for example, retail stores (clothing, bookstores, florists, etc.) could offer curbside pickup, and manufacturing supply chains for those retailers could resume. However, higher-risk establishments (dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons, etc.) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order was part of the gradual reopening that led into summer – by July, many local retailers were operating (at least in curbside or limited-capacity modes) thanks to the Stage 2 easing. The rationale was to revive economic activity while still controlling spread. However, because COVID surged in summer 2020, these initial reopenings were soon paused or reversed (see July order below), which significantly affected businesses in Q3 2020 – many had to scale back operations again just weeks after reopening, underscoring the tenuous situation that quarter.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 [Source: “【18†L49-L57】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021 [Source: “【22†L407-L414】”]  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system; and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions.

  Summary:
  In July 2020, California experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. In response, the State Health Officer re-imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. Statewide, this July 13 order closed many indoor operations that had been allowed in Stage 2: for example, restaurants had to shut indoor dining (outdoor and take-out were allowed), bars, breweries and movie theaters were closed, and museums/zoos were closed again indoors. Additionally, counties on the state’s monitoring list (areas with the worst outbreaks, which included Ventura County) had to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non‐critical offices, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and malls. This had a major impact in Q3 2020: Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June had to partially or fully close again in July. For example, restaurants in Camarillo during Q3 2020 could only offer outdoor dining or takeout, and gyms and salons were forced shut for the remainder of the summer. These renewed restrictions in the middle of Q3 dramatically cut business revenues and operations. The reason for this rollback was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID-19” in California – essentially, the summer surge forced the state to hit the “emergency brake,” directly affecting businesses in that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) [Source: “【51†L68-L76】”]  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [Source: “【22†L407-L414】”]  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective 6/15/2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system.

  Summary:
  California unveiled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on Aug. 28, 2020 as a long-term, color-coded tier system for COVID-19 restrictions. This new framework replaced the blunt monitoring-list closures with a graduated, risk-based approach. Every county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial, Orange = moderate, Yellow = minimal) based on local case rates and positivity%. Each tier set specific rules for businesses: e.g. in Purple tier (the most restrictive), many non-essential indoor business operations were prohibited, whereas in Red or Orange tiers, certain indoor operations could open with capacity limits. Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on Aug 31, 2020, since case rates were high. In Q3 2020, this meant that although the blanket July closures were lifted, most Camarillo businesses still faced heavy restrictions: retail stores could open indoors with limited capacity, but indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed in Purple tier (only outdoor or take-home services allowed). As conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier by October, easing some rules. The Blueprint’s purpose was to provide a predictable structure: it gradually reopened businesses in Q3/Q4 2020 when COVID metrics improved, but also allowed tightening if metrics worsened. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, the Blueprint meant their operating status was tied to Ventura County’s tier – and during that quarter the county was mostly in the most restrictive tier, explaining why many businesses were still severely limited. The tier system remained in effect until statewide vaccinations and declining cases enabled California to “retire” the Blueprint on June 15, 2021, at which point nearly all business restrictions were lifted.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in SoCal region Dec 6, 2020) [Source: “【59†L55-L63】【59†L75-L83】”]  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 [Source: “【54†L355-L363】”]  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order statewide (Jan. 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved.

  Summary:
  In late 2020, facing a dire winter COVID surge, California introduced the Regional Stay-at-Home Order – a stricter lockdown tied to ICU capacity. Ventura County is part of the Southern California region, which fell below the 15% ICU availability threshold on Dec. 4, 2020, triggering this order. The Regional Order essentially pulled counties back to full shutdown if their region’s hospitals were in crisis. It required the closure of many business sectors, both indoor and outdoor: e.g. restaurants had to stop outdoor dining (take-out only), personal care services (hair and nail salons) closed entirely, movie theaters, museums, and amusement centers closed, and retail stores had to further reduce capacity (down to 20%). This was the most stringent measure since spring. Although this order took effect in Q4 2020, its impact carried into early Q1 2021, and it highlighted the precarious situation businesses faced. (By Q3 2020, businesses might have hoped the worst was over, but the emergence of this order in December showed that restrictions could return if conditions worsened.) Q3 2020 itself was not directly under the Regional Stay-at-Home Order, but the looming threat of a resurgent virus (which materialized in winter) meant businesses remained cautious. The Regional Order was lifted on Jan. 25, 2021 when ICU forecasts improved, putting Ventura County back into the Purple tier system. The existence of this emergency brake mechanism is a reminder of why Q3 2020 business conditions were tenuous – the pandemic’s trajectory was uncertain, and even a quarter later businesses would face another round of closures due to factors (ICU strain) that were already a concern in mid-2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021) [Source: “【20†L63-L70】【22†L407-L414】”]  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order ended prior orders – California’s underlying state of emergency continued, but without the business closures/tier framework)

  Summary:
  This pair of orders (Governor’s EO and a State Health Officer Order) marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. They formally terminated the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order (EO N-33-20) and “retired” the Blueprint tier system statewide. Practically, it lifted capacity limits, distancing requirements, and most other COVID-related operating restrictions on businesses. After this date, Camarillo businesses could generally operate at pre-pandemic levels (subject only to any remaining mask rules or industry-specific guidance). In the context of Q3 2020, this June 2021 milestone highlights how far into the future the restrictions persisted. The fact that California did not fully lift business constraints until mid-2021 underscores why Q3 2020 was heavily impacted – businesses spent that quarter under evolving but continued rules, awaiting a normalcy that came roughly three quarters later. The reason this “Beyond the Blueprint” order could be issued was improving public health metrics (dropping cases and widespread vaccinations by spring 2021), which were absent in Q3 2020 – thus, businesses in mid-2020 had to contend with the stricter earlier orders until conditions allowed this final reopening.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 [Source: “【38†L19-L27】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–21 (county emergency remained in effect; ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, beyond our scope)

  Summary:
  Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020 in response to COVID-19. This was quickly ratified by county authorities. The declaration itself did not impose restrictions on businesses, but it provided the legal basis for the County Health Officer to issue health orders and for the county to coordinate emergency resources. By establishing that a health emergency existed locally, it allowed Ventura County to mirror and enforce state orders (like shelter-in-place) and to act swiftly in targeting local outbreak conditions. For Q3 2020, this emergency status was still active, meaning Ventura County had the ongoing authority to issue local rules affecting Camarillo businesses. The local emergency’s continuation into late 2020 was due to the sustained threat of COVID-19 – it justified why the county could keep certain local rules (like mask recommendations or enforcement of state directives) in place, thereby impacting businesses throughout the quarter.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020 [Source: “【61†L78-L83】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this order.

  Summary:
  Prior to the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions. The March 17, 2020 health officer order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain businesses and public facilities until at least April 2, 2020. In practice, this meant that even before Newsom’s statewide mandate, Ventura County had shut down venues like bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theaters, and limited restaurants to take-out only. This local order was quickly eclipsed by the more comprehensive March 19 state order, and the county rolled it into a broader local stay-home order on March 20. However, it set the tone for aggressive local action. By Q3 2020, the specifics of the March 17 order had long been overtaken by later rules, but its legacy was that Ventura County did not hesitate to impose stricter measures if needed. The early timing shows the county’s proactive approach, which continued through 2020. The reason this order came about was immediate concern over COVID-19 spread in mid-March – and that same concern persisted into Q3, explaining why Ventura County remained vigilant with local enforcement of health measures that quarter.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-Home Order  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020 [Source: “【61†L95-L102】”]  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions [Sources: “【9†L27-L35】” and “【7†L29-L35】”])  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order June 15, 2021, which noted the end of the Governor’s stay-home order and lifted remaining local restrictions.

  Summary:
  Ventura County’s Stay Well at Home order, issued March 20, 2020, was the local companion to California’s statewide stay-home mandate. It required all Ventura County residents to stay at their residences except for essential needs or jobs, and it closed all non-essential businesses and activities. This order made the state’s directives enforceable at the local level and added some county-specific provisions (like definitions of essential businesses and local enforcement mechanisms). Under this order, virtually all Camarillo businesses had to cease in-person operations unless they were on the essential list (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, healthcare, etc.). This county lockdown was initially set through April 19, 2020, but it was extended multiple times as the pandemic continued. By Q3 2020, the original “Stay Well at Home” order had been amended to allow partial reopenings, but many of its core restrictions were still indirectly affecting businesses. For example, even if the strict stay-home was no longer in full force by July, capacity limits and partial closures (originating from this order’s framework) were still in effect. The reason it continued (in evolving form) through Q3 was that COVID-19 cases remained significant – the county could not simply lift the stay-home order without replacement rules until the public health situation improved. Thus, this order’s prolonged life explains why Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 were still under significant restrictions, as the county only exited the stay-home framework when the state did in June 2021.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates:
    – March 31, 2020: Extended stay-home to 4/19/2020 [Source: “【6†L73-L77】”]
    – April 9, 2020: Added gathering ban and safety protocols [Source: “【13†L49-L57】【13†L39-L47】”]
    – April 20, 2020: Further extended stay-home through 5/15/2020 [Sources: “【61†L95-L102】【61†L78-L83】”]
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond); fully rescinded by the May 7, 2020 county order that repealed the April orders in favor of state-aligned regulations.
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020, which repealed the April 9 and April 20 orders and replaced them with the “Safely Reopening” order aligning with the state roadmap.

  Summary:
  Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its stay-home order. On March 31, 2020, the Health Officer extended the existing order’s duration. Then on April 9, 2020, amid the first surge, an updated order prohibited all gatherings (of any size outside a single household) and required all essential businesses that remained open to implement social distancing protocols (posting COVID safety plans, ensuring 6-foot distancing, etc.). An April 20, 2020 order further tightened definitions of essential businesses and continued the stay-home requirements into May. These updates impacted businesses by adding new compliance steps – for example, grocery stores and pharmacies in Camarillo had to post distancing guidelines and limit entry, and any loopholes for quasi-non-essential operations were closed. In Q3 2020, those specific spring orders were no longer active (they had been replaced by the reopening framework), but their effects lingered: the habit of safety protocols (masking, distancing) and the baseline assumption that gatherings were banned carried forward. Essentially, these orders laid the groundwork for how businesses would operate when they were allowed to reopen – with distancing, masking, and limits. The reason the county kept extending and amending the stay-home order in early 2020 was the ongoing high case counts; this persistence meant that by Q3 2020, businesses were still reopening under conditions dictated by those earlier protocols.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and an amendment on May 20, 2020 [Sources: “【6†L64-L72】【29†L437-L445】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint (Aug 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 reopening (when no local restrictions remained).
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order Aug. 31, 2020 (which aligned the county with the state Blueprint Tier 1) and ultimately the June 15, 2021 state order ending all tiered restrictions.

  Summary:
  In early May 2020, as California signaled initial reopening, Ventura County’s Health Officer issued the “Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” order to implement Stage 2 locally. The May 7, 2020 order repealed the stricter April county orders and allowed Ventura County to move in step with the state’s Phase 2 reopening starting May 8. This meant certain businesses could reopen with safety measures—for example, retailers with curbside pickup, manufacturing, logistics, and warehouses supporting retail could resume work. Then, on May 20, 2020, after the county received state approval for an “accelerated Stage 2” variance, the order was amended to allow dine-in restaurants and in-store retail with precautions. By late May, Camarillo restaurants were allowed to reopen for dine-in service (with reduced capacity and COVID protocols) and malls/shopping centers could open at limited capacity. For businesses in Q3 2020, these May orders were significant because they set the stage for what level of opening was possible by summer. Thanks to these orders, many Camarillo businesses were open in Q3 (unlike the complete shutdown of April) – however, they operated under the constant threat that reopening could be rolled back (as indeed happened in July). The Safely Reopening plan required each business to implement a COVID prevention plan and other safety measures. Thus, while these orders enabled a cautious economic revival, when the summer surge hit in July the later restrictions forced many businesses to scale back again.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020) [Source: “【39†L5-L12】”]  
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (the order was limited to the Independence Day weekend)  
  Rescinded By: The order expired after July 5, 2020.

  Summary:
  Anticipating crowding over the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID cases, Ventura County’s health officer ordered beaches closed and beach parking lots off-limits for the July 4, 2020 weekend. This short-term order aimed to prevent mass gatherings that could become super-spreader events. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this meant that any tourism or beach-related commerce (in nearby coastal areas like Ventura/Oxnard) was temporarily curtailed during what would normally be a busy weekend. For example, beach-adjacent restaurants saw fewer visitors and outdoor recreation companies lost potential holiday business. This order highlights how targeted closures were enacted at short notice in response to case trends, underscoring why Q3 2020 was challenging for businesses.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) [Source: “【9†L31-L39】”]  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved to Tier 2) [Source: “【9†L31-L39】”]  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on Oct. 6, 2020, which allowed certain indoor operations to reopen and explicitly rescinded parts of the July 13 order.

  Summary:
  Following Governor Newsom’s July 13 statewide closures, Ventura County’s health officer issued a local order to implement those restrictions countywide. The July 13, 2020 local order re-closed indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care services that had been open, in line with the state mandate. It essentially ensured that Ventura County businesses complied with the state’s rollback requirements. In Q3 2020, this meant that fitness studios, churches, nail salons, tattoo parlors, and similar personal service businesses in Camarillo had to shut down indoor services again in July. Some businesses operating outdoors could continue, but those that could not easily move operations outside remained closed until the local conditions improved. This order is a clear explanation of why many Q3 2020 businesses in Camarillo, particularly in the fitness, personal care, and hospitality sectors, experienced a second round of closures due to the summer surge in cases.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020 [Sources: “【9†L13-L21】” and “【9†L31-L39】”]  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (superseded by the December 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order, then by a return to the Purple tier in January 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Effectively superseded by the Dec. 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order; formally, all county orders were nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening.

  Summary:
  By early October 2020, Ventura County’s COVID-19 rates had improved enough to move from the Purple tier to the Red tier in the state’s Blueprint system. The Health Officer’s Oct. 6 order acknowledged this by allowing specified businesses to reopen indoor operations with restrictions. It rescinded portions of the July 13 closure order – notably permitting gyms/fitness centers, houses of worship, and personal care services (like nail salons) to resume indoor activities in compliance with safety protocols. Although this order came after Q3 2020, it is directly tied to the Q3 experience: many businesses endured closures or strict limits from July through September, and this October easing represented the first sign of relief. For a Camarillo business operating in late Q3 (September), the nearing possibility of indoor reopening under the Red tier offered hope—even though the summer restrictions severely affected revenues during Q3. 

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020) [Sources: “【6†L66-L72】” and “【66†L144-L150】”]  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, the moratorium was in effect through Sept. 30, 2020; for residential cases, it was replaced by state law (via AB 3088) effective from Sept. 1, 2020.
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; Ventura County’s commercial moratorium extended through Sept. 2020 per available records.

  Summary:
  Recognizing the financial hardship on both residents and businesses, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors approved an urgency ordinance (No. 4563) preventing evictions of tenants—both residential and small-business commercial—in the unincorporated areas facing COVID-19–related income losses. This ordinance, which initially was set to expire May 31, 2020, was extended and provided a crucial safety net preventing landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent due to pandemic hardships. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this meant that if they had lost revenue in earlier months and were behind on rent, they had legal protection from eviction, giving them a chance to survive until the situation improved. While it did not forgive rent, it delayed eviction proceedings and helped keep businesses from being permanently forced out of their locations amid ongoing pandemic restrictions.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36 on March 13, 2020) [Source: “【38†L29-L37】”]  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained in effect into 2021; lifted in 2022 following state/county lead)  
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022, outside our timeframe).

  Summary:
  On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19. City Manager Dave Norman (acting as the EOC Director) issued Order No. 20-1 and the City Council ratified it that same day. This proclamation activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed the deployment of resources and emergency measures quickly. As a result, city facilities (such as City Hall, the public library, and community centers) were closed, and public events canceled. For local businesses, this emergency declaration also meant that the city could enact regulatory relief measures (for example, streamlining permit processes for outdoor operations) to help them adapt. The continued local emergency status in Q3 2020 meant that the city maintained the authority to enforce or adjust COVID-related rules, which in turn influenced customer behavior and local business operations.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and an Amendment (April 23, 2020) [Source: “【35†L218-L222】”]  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial order), amended April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law (Sept. 2020 for residential cases) and expired with the end of the local emergency for any remaining commercial provisions.
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, the state’s COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; later the city ended its local emergency in 2022.

  Summary:
  In order to protect its residents and small businesses, the City of Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium on March 18, 2020 (Order No. 20-2) that applied to both residential and commercial tenants affected by COVID-19–related financial hardship. This order was amended on April 23, 2020 to extend its provisions. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 that were struggling with reduced income, this temporary ban prevented landlords from evicting them for nonpayment of rent, providing critical time to adjust and plan for reopening. Although the moratorium did not cancel overdue rent, it offered important protection against unwanted and immediate legal action during the crisis.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)  
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local COVID emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022.

  Summary:
  To help restaurants survive while indoor dining was restricted, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020-63 in June 2020. This emergency measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas on parking lots, sidewalks, or other available open spaces. By reducing permitting hurdles and fees, the city enabled restaurants to quickly expand their seating to outdoor spaces. In Q3 2020, when indoor dining was still not fully allowed due to ongoing restrictions, this measure provided a lifeline, permitting restaurants to operate and serve customers outdoors. This not only helped businesses generate revenue during a tough period but also assisted in maintaining jobs and community access to dining options under safe, socially distant conditions.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various during 2020 (spring–summer)

  Summary:
  In addition to the major orders noted above, the City of Camarillo implemented several other measures to mitigate the pandemic’s economic impact on local businesses. For example, the city suspended late fees for business taxes, moved permit processes online (especially for construction projects), and promoted take-out dining campaigns to support local restaurants. The city also cooperated with Ventura County on code enforcement to ensure businesses complied with COVID-19 health orders. Together, these measures helped reshape the local regulatory landscape in Q3 2020, balancing public health needs and economic survival in the community.

General Conclusions on Q3 2020 Impact

Across all levels—federal, state, county, and city—the COVID-19 measures during 2020 and into early 2021 created a layered and evolving set of restrictions that had a profound impact on businesses in Camarillo. In Q3 2020, while some sectors had begun to reopen under modified orders (such as outdoor dining permitted by local resolutions or limited retail operations under state reopening orders), many businesses still faced significant constraints due to recurring closures and rollback orders sparked by surges in cases. The continued presence of statewide emergency declarations, local health orders, and the threat of further closures (as seen in the July and December orders) contributed to an ongoing atmosphere of uncertainty and reduced operational capacity. Financial protections like eviction moratoria helped mitigate immediate losses but did not fully offset the economic strain—explaining why Q3 2020 was a uniquely challenging quarter for local businesses.
