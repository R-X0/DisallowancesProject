I. Federal Orders
─────────────────────────────

1. Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not formally rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later terminated by Congress in 2023)
 • Rescinded By: A later congressional action (after 2021)
 • Summary: On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994 the President declared a national emergency due to the COVID‑19 pandemic. This declaration activated the use of emergency powers and funding that, in turn, enabled state and local public health measures such as business restrictions and lockdowns. Although the proclamation did not itself require business closures, its existence set the stage for subsequent state and local orders. In Q3 2020, even though federal guidelines were not mandating closures, businesses in Camarillo still operated under an environment indirectly shaped by this ongoing national emergency.

2. CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
 • Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (by Executive Order and subsequent CDC directions)  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (remained effective throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022 by court order)
 • Rescinded By: A court decision in April 2022  
 • Summary: Although not directly causing business closures, federal mask mandates for travel (applicable on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties) provided further guidance on public health measures. These requirements were part of the federal administration’s efforts to ensure safe interstate travel in the midst of the pandemic. For businesses in Camarillo during Q3 2020 the direct effect was minimal because these mandates were implemented in early 2021; however, they demonstrate the continuing evolution of federal responses as the pandemic persisted.

II. California State Orders
─────────────────────────────

1. State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID‑19 State of Emergency
 • Informal Order Number: N/A (Governor’s proclamation)
 • Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended in February 2023)
 • Rescinded By: Later by Governor’s proclamation in 2023 (outside our timeframe)
 • Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020. This proclamation allowed the state to mobilize all available resources, suspend certain laws, and ultimately provided the legal authority for later orders that shut down or restricted business activities. Throughout Q3 2020, this emergency status underpinned practically all other COVID‑related restrictions in California.
 • Link: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/

2. Executive Order N‑33‑20 – Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order  
 • Date Enacted: March 19, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021) formally ended the Stay‑at‑Home order
 • Summary: This order required all California residents to remain at home except for essential activities. It forced “non‑essential” businesses—such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, and others—to close or operate under extreme limitations. Even though by Q3 2020 some sectors had been allowed to reopen in modified forms, many operating rules (like reduced capacity or outdoor-only service) still derived from the restrictions first established by EO N‑33‑20.
 • Link: (For the attested PDF of EO N‑33‑20, see) https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf

3. State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening)  
 • Order Details: Issued May 7, 2020 (via EO N‑60‑20)  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” Order)
 • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)
 • Summary: As case numbers plateaued after the initial lockdown, California eased restrictions by permitting lower‑risk businesses to reopen under new health protocols. The May 7 order allowed non‑high‑risk sectors (such as many retail operations) to resume on a limited “curbside” basis with safety measures in place, while high‑risk establishments (like dine‑in restaurants and gyms) remained closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, these orders set the stage for a partial reopening that was quickly rolled back as cases surged again in July 2020.

4. State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Rollback of Reopening  
 • Date: July 13, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally terminated on June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: The subsequent State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the “Beyond Blueprint” order
 • Summary: In response to a sharp rise in cases during the summer, the state re‑imposed closures on indoor operations of sectors that had reopened under Stage 2. This rollback meant that many interior services (such as indoor dining, bars, movie theaters, and personal care establishments) were forced to close or operate only in restricted outdoor formats during Q3 2020. Businesses in Camarillo—having experienced at least temporary reopenings in May/June—faced an abrupt second wave of closures in July.

5. “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color‑Tier Reopening System  
 • Order: State Health Officer Order issued August 28, 2020; effective August 31, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 15, 2021)
 • Summary: This framework replaced older “list‑based” orders with a risk‑based tier system where counties were assigned a color (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID‑19 case metrics. Ventura County (thus Camarillo) was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that many indoor business operations remained closed or heavily limited during Q3 2020. The expectation was that as conditions improved, restrictions would gradually ease; however, for most of Q3 the tier–based measures continued to significantly affect business operations.

6. Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
 • Order Date: Announced December 3, 2020 (effective December 6, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
 • Rescinded By: The statewide lifting of the Regional Order when ICU projections improved
 • Summary: Although primarily affecting the winter period, this order was aimed at regions where hospitals were nearing critical ICU shortages. While it did not directly govern the conditions of Q3 2020, its announcement underscored the continued threat of the virus and the possibility that restrictions could be re‑imposed if hospital capacity fell—adding to the uncertainty seen by businesses even in Q3.
 • Link: https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/

7. “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order  
 • Order: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Health Officer Order  
 • Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
 • Date Rescinded: This order did not “rescind” restrictions but rather terminated earlier stay‑at‑home and tier‑based orders.
 • Summary: This order marked the end of the statewide restrictions (such as capacity limits, the Stay‑at‑Home Order and the Blueprint tier system) as public health metrics and vaccination rates improved. Although its effect began in mid‑2021, its existence highlights how long the restrictive measures persisted. Because full reopening did not occur until June 2021, businesses in Q3 2020 still operated under the earlier, far stricter guidelines.

III. Ventura County Orders
─────────────────────────────

1. Ventura County Local Health Emergency  
 • Order Date: March 12, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended later in 2022)
 • Summary: In response to the emerging pandemic, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer (Dr. Robert Levin) declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. Although this declaration did not directly impose business restrictions, it established the legal authority for the county to issue more specific orders later. Its continuation through Q3 2020 meant that the county retained the authority to enforce and update health orders affecting local businesses.
 • (No external link provided; reference made to [38†L19-L27].)

2. Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
 • Order Date: March 17, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order
 • Summary: This early county order required vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of select businesses and public venues. It targeted establishments such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, and movie theaters even before the statewide order was issued. Though quickly replaced by later orders, it set an early precedent for strict local action.
 • (No external link provided; see [61†L78-L83].)

3. “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County)  
 • Order Date: March 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in line with state reopening; formally ended by a June 15, 2021 update)
 • Summary: This countywide order mandated that all Ventura County residents remain at home except for essential needs and work at critical infrastructure. As a local companion to the state’s stay‑at‑home directive, it forced nearly all non‑essential Camarillo businesses to shut down in‑person operations. Although amendments later allowed for limited reopening, the core restrictions influenced business operations well into Q3 2020.
 • (No external link provided; see [61†L95-L102].)

4. Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020)  
 • Order Dates: March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Replaced by the “Safely Reopening Ventura County” order on May 7, 2020
 • Summary: The county periodically extended and tightened its “Stay Well at Home” order—adding a ban on gatherings, social distancing protocols, and extending the duration of restrictions. These updates forced essential businesses to adjust by developing safety plans and reducing capacity. Their legacy was seen throughout Q3 2020 as reopened businesses had to operate under the safety measures first established in these early orders.
 • (No external link provided; references available in [6†L73-L77], [13†L49-L57], and [61†L99-L107].)

5. “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 Reopening  
 • Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint (effective August 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 order
 • Summary: As conditions temporarily improved, the county issued this order to allow selected lower‑risk businesses (such as curbside retail and later dine‑in restaurants under strict protocols) to reopen. For Camarillo businesses, it meant that by late May 2020 some operations resumed—only to be disrupted again by later practice. This order shows how businesses were given a brief window of reopening before the summer surge forced a rollback.

6. Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure  
 • Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5 weekend  
 • Date Rescinded: Automatically expired after July 5, 2020
 • Summary: In anticipation of heavy crowds and to curb the spread of COVID‑19, Ventura County ordered the closure of its beaches and parking lots during the Independence Day weekend. Although Camarillo is inland, the order affected regional tourism and related business activity.
 • Link: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/

7. Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of the State Rollback  
 • Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county shifted to a less restrictive tier
 • Summary: In response to Governor Newsom’s statewide rollback order, Ventura County re‑closed indoor operations for many sectors such as gyms, churches, and personal care services. For Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses found themselves forced to end indoor services abruptly in July, with only outdoor or take‑out options remaining.
 • (No external link provided; referenced as [9†L31-L39].)

8. Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order  
 • Order Date: October 6, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Later overridden by the December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and subsequent changes; ultimately county restrictions ended with the June 15, 2021 state order
 • Summary: As local case rates improved, Ventura County transitioned into the Red tier on October 6, 2020. This allowed some indoor operations to resume under strict conditions for sectors such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care. For a business in late Q3 2020 (approaching the fall), this order offered the first easing of the heavy restrictions imposed over the summer.
 • (No separate link provided.)

9. Ventura County Eviction Moratorium  
 • Order Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
 • Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020)  
 • Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; residential protections later superseded by state law (AB 3088 effective September 2020)  
 • Summary: To ease financial strain, Ventura County issued this ordinance to temporarily ban evictions of residential and small‑business commercial tenants impacted by COVID‑19. For local business owners (for example, a small retail shop in Camarillo), this protection meant they could defer rent payments without the immediate risk of eviction during the worst months of the pandemic.

───────────────────────────── 
IV. City of Camarillo Orders
─────────────────────────────

1. Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo)
 • Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1
 • Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36 on the same day)
 • Date Rescinded: Remained in effect through 2020–2021 (formally ended in 2022)
 • Summary: The City of Camarillo declared a local emergency on March 13, 2020 to quickly mobilize city resources. This proclamation led to the closure of city facilities and the cancellation of public events, reinforcing the seriousness of the pandemic locally. Its ongoing status through 2020 meant that the city retained the legal basis to enforce subsequent health and safety measures affecting local businesses.
 • (No external link provided.)

2. Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders
 • Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (March 18, 2020) and its Amendment (April 23, 2020)
 • Date Enacted: March 18, 2020; amended April 23, 2020
 • Date Rescinded: Later superseded by state law for residential tenants (AB 3088 effective August 31, 2020) and ended when city emergency concluded for commercial matters
 • Summary: To protect local residents and business tenants from immediate displacement, Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium that barred evictions due to COVID‑related financial hardship. This local measure paralleled the county’s ordinance, ensuring that within city limits affected tenants would have critical short‑term relief.
 • (No external link provided.)

3. Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program
 • Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
 • Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively lifted as full indoor dining resumed on June 15, 2021)
 • Summary: Recognizing the challenges faced by restaurants unable to serve customers indoors, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution No. 2020‑63. This resolution waived certain zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to set up temporary outdoor dining areas on sidewalks, parking lots, and other open spaces. In Q3 2020, this measure enabled many local eateries to continue serving patrons safely despite indoor restrictions.

4. Miscellaneous Camarillo City Measures
 • Dates: Various throughout spring–summer 2020
 • Summary: Additional supportive actions included suspending late fees on business taxes, streamlining and moving permit processes online, and promoting take‑out dining campaigns to help local restaurants. City code enforcement worked in coordination with Ventura County to ensure compliance with health orders. Although not “orders” per se, these steps were an integral part of the city’s overall response and had real effects on how local businesses operated during Q3 2020.

Closing Summary
─────────────────────────────

Throughout 2020–2021, a layered response from the federal government, the State of California, Ventura County, and the City of Camarillo created a patchwork of orders and regulatory measures that greatly affected business operations. In Q3 2020 especially, many Camarillo businesses had to contend with the legacy of a strict statewide stay‑at‑home order, subsequent partial reopenings under a tier‑based “Blueprint” system, and local mandates (such as outdoor dining programs and eviction moratoria) that both constrained operations and provided critical relief. This comprehensive transcript—presenting dates, identifying numbers (where available), detailed summaries, and links—reflects the complexity of managing business impacts during an unprecedented public health emergency.
