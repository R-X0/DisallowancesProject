Dear Appeals Officer,

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing 34213’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for the second quarter of 2020. The disallowance was premised on an assertion that “no government orders were in effect” during Q2 2020 that caused a suspension or curtailment of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Multiple federal, state, county, and city government orders were active during Q2 2020, and each imposed COVID‑19–related restrictions that directly limited our normal operations. In this letter, we provide a detailed timeline of the pertinent government orders, demonstrate how they affected our business activities, and reference applicable IRS guidance supporting our qualification for the ERC under the “partial suspension” provisions.

Summary and Request

It is clear from the timeline above that 34213 was subject to a wide spectrum of overlapping government orders in Q2 2020. Although some orders permitted a partial reopening, the cumulative effect was a significant curtailment of normal business operations. These limitations meet the definition of a “partial suspension” under IRS guidance for ERC eligibility. 

In view of the above facts and supporting order evidence, we respectfully request that the IRS reconsider and reverse the disallowance of our Q2 2020 ERC claim. The credit claimed was in full compliance with applicable law and guidance, and the orders imposed more than a nominal disruption on our business operations. We have enclosed copies of the relevant government orders and a detailed analysis of their impact on our business as documentation for your review.

Attestation: “Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I submitted the protest and accompanying documents, and to the best of my personal knowledge and belief, the information stated in the protest and accompanying documents is true, correct, and complete.”

Sincerely,
