RE: Formal Protest to Letter [ ] – ERC Disallowance for Q2  
Tax Period: 2nd Quarter 2020 (202004–202006)  
Claim Amount: [ ]

Dear Appeals Officer,

We write in response to the IRS notice disallowing Elden Inc.’s Employee Retention Credit (ERC) claim for the second quarter of 2020. The notice asserts that no governmental orders were in effect during Q2 2020 that caused a suspension of our operations. We respectfully disagree. Multiple federal, state, county, and city government orders imposed COVID‑19 related restrictions that forced a partial suspension of our normal business operations. In the following timeline, we provide a detailed summary of the key orders in effect during Q2 2020 and demonstrate their direct impact on Elden Inc.

Timeline of COVID‑19 Government Orders Active in Q2 2020

Conclusion and Request

The series of governmental orders detailed above clearly demonstrate that Elden Inc. was subject to multiple COVID‑19 related mandates during Q2 2020 that collectively resulted in a partial suspension of its normal business operations. Based on IRS guidance regarding the ERC eligibility criteria and the “partial suspension” test, we respectfully request that the IRS reconsider its position and reverse the disallowance of our ERC claim for the second quarter of 2020.

Under penalties of perjury, I attest that I have examined the relevant documents and that the facts stated in this protest and the accompanying documentation are true, correct, and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Sincerely,
