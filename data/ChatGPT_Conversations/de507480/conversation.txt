COVID‑19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – *National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19*  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (Source: https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021, same link as above)  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (for example, stimulus aid) was available, but strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – *Federal Mask Requirements for Travel*  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)  
  Summary: Although not directly a business closure measure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask‑wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and the subsequent CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), though it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about—and would later affect travel-related businesses—was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid‑2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures; however, the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Federal Note: The primary COVID‑related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, there was no nationwide lockdown; instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

────────────────────────────
California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – *California COVID‑19 State of Emergency*  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 (Source: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID‑19. This emergency empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (for example, suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant that extraordinary measures—such as fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance—were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020; the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – *Statewide “Stay‑at‑Home” Order*  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (Source: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf#:~:text=March%2019%2C%202020%20To%20protect,may%20designate%20additional%20sectors%20as) (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (Source: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=1%29%20Executive%20Order%20N,based%20framework%20for%20reopening%20the)  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order effective 6/15/2021; also superseded by later phased reopening orders  
  Summary: This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to stay at home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors. It forced “non‑essential” businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) either to close or to operate at minimal levels, while “essential” businesses (like food stores, pharmacies, and banks) could remain open under strict precautions. By Q3 2020, while some sectors had gradually reopened, many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints inherited from this original shutdown. For example, many retail shops and restaurants were permitted only outdoor or reduced‑capacity operations because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay‑home mandate. The order, which remained in effect “until further notice,” reflected the sustained risk of COVID‑19 and explains why Camarillo businesses continued under significant restrictions during Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – *Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)*  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N‑60‑20) (Source: Referenced document from cdph.ca.gov)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (Superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order, Source: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint-6-11-2021.aspx#:~:text=5,State%20Public%20Health%20Officer%20Order)  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), Section 5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order  
  Summary: As COVID‑19 case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California entered “Stage 2” of reopening. In line with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the earlier stay‑home restrictions. It permitted lower‑risk businesses to reopen with modifications – for instance, retail stores such as clothing shops, bookstores, and florists were allowed to offer curbside pickup, and supporting manufacturing and supply chain operations could resume. At the same time, higher‑risk establishments (like dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order represented the beginning of a gradual reopening that enabled some economic activity by summer, although later in the quarter many businesses faced additional rollbacks due to a summer surge in cases.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – *Statewide Rollback of Reopening*  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (Source: Referenced from cdph.ca.gov documents)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system and later by the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order  
  Summary: In response to a sharp rise in COVID‑19 cases in July 2020, the State Health Officer re‑imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. This July 13 order mandated the closure of many indoor operations that had been allowed during Stage 2. For example, restaurants were forced to shut down indoor dining (although outdoor and take‑out service were permitted), and bars, breweries, movie theaters, and indoor venues like museums and zoos were closed. In addition, counties on the state’s monitoring list—including Ventura County—were required to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non‑critical offices, personal care services (such as nail salons and tattoo parlors), and malls. For Camarillo businesses, this meant that many establishments which had reopened in May or June had to close or severely limit indoor operations again in July, markedly impacting revenue and operations in Q3 2020. The state’s rationale was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID‑19,” effectively using the order as an “emergency brake” on reopening.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – *Color‑Tier Reopening System*  
  Order Number: State Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) (Source: https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/08/28/governor-newsom-unveils-blueprint-for-a-safer-economy-a-statewide-stringent-and-slow-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,the%20trajectory%20of%20the%20disease)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (effective June 15, 2021), which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system  
  Summary: California unveiled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on August 28, 2020 as a long‑term, color‑coded tier system for regulating COVID‑19 restrictions. Under this framework, each county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial, Orange = moderate, Yellow = minimal) based on local COVID‑19 metrics. The rules for businesses varied by tier—for example, in the most restrictive Purple tier, many non‑essential indoor operations were prohibited, while in Red or Orange tiers, some indoor operations could reopen at reduced capacity. Ventura County (and therefore Camarillo) was placed in the Purple tier on August 31, 2020 due to its high case rates. In Q3 2020, although the blanket July closures had been lifted, most businesses still faced heavy restrictions; retail stores might reopen indoors at limited capacity, while indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed. The framework was designed to balance public health protection with gradual economic reopening, but for many Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, being tied to the county’s tier status meant continued strict limits until conditions improved.
  
• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – *ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown*  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in the Southern California region on December 6, 2020) (Source: https://www.cityofmontclair.org/december-5-2020-regional-stay-at-home-order/#:~:text=Late%20Friday%2C%20December%204%2C%202020%2C,the%20day%20before)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (Source: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/supplement-regional-stay-at-home-order.aspx#:~:text=LetterAuthority)  
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order statewide on Jan. 25, 2021 once ICU projections improved  
  Summary: In late 2020, amid a worsening winter surge, California introduced the Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order—a stricter lockdown measure that activated if a region’s hospitals fell below a critical ICU bed threshold (in this case, below 15% availability; Ventura County’s hospitals met this criterion on December 4, 2020). The order mandated that if a region triggered the threshold, counties would have to close many business sectors both indoors and (in some cases) outdoors. Although this order officially applied in Q4 2020, its looming threat underscored why—even without being directly in force during Q3 2020—businesses remained cautious. The possibility of rapidly re‑imposed shutdowns due to ICU strain contributed to the overall state of economic and operational uncertainty in Q3 2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – *Termination of Stay‑at‑Home/Tiers*  
  Order Number: Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021) (Sources: https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.11.21-EO-N-07-21-signed.pdf#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20Governor%20Gavin%20Newsom,county%20tier%20system%20will%20end and related CDPH order)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order itself ended prior orders)  
  Rescinded By: This order superseded and effectively rescinded all previous COVID‑related business restrictions (while the underlying state of emergency continued, the specific restrictions on businesses were terminated)  
  Summary: The “Beyond the Blueprint” order marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. It formally terminated the March 2020 Stay‑at‑Home Order and “retired” the Blueprint tier system statewide. Practically, it removed capacity limits, physical distancing mandates, and most other COVID‑related operating restrictions on businesses. In hindsight, this date highlights just how prolonged the period of economic constraint was: by Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo were still under rigid restrictions that would not be fully lifted until mid‑2021. The order was possible only because improved public health metrics and increased vaccination rates made a full reopening viable, contrasting sharply with the dire conditions faced by businesses during Q3 2020.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – *County Declaration of Local Health Emergency*  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 (Source: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=spread%20of%20COVID,and%20local%20public%20health%20officials)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained in effect; ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID‑19 emergency (March 2022; beyond our timeframe)  
  Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency in response to COVID‑19. Although the declaration did not at first impose restrictions on businesses, it provided the legal basis for subsequent local health orders and enabled the county to coordinate emergency resources. By formally establishing a local health emergency, Ventura County was empowered to adopt and enforce measures in line with state directives. In Q3 2020, this emergency status remained in force, ensuring that local authorities could continue to issue or enforce rules that directly impacted Camarillo businesses. The sustained emergency demonstrated that the threat had not diminished, allowing the county to maintain rigorous health protocols throughout the quarter.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – *Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions*  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020 (Source: https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=7,101040%2C%20101085%20and%20120175%20directing)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020 which supplemented and expanded this initial order  
  Summary: Prior to the statewide stay‑at‑home directive, Ventura County issued an early order on March 17, 2020 directing vulnerable residents to shelter in place and order the closure of certain public facilities and businesses until at least April 2, 2020. In practical terms, the order led Ventura County to shut down venues such as bars, nightclubs, gyms, and movie theaters (with restaurants limited to take‑out). Although this local order was quickly incorporated into the broader March 20 “Stay Well at Home” directive, it set an early example of the county’s proactive stance. This early action underscores the county’s strong commitment to limiting virus spread—a commitment that continued to be felt in Q3 2020, even though the specific March 17 measures had since been overtaken by newer orders.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – *Countywide Stay‑Home Order*  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020 (Source: https://aagla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/extension-or-the-ordinance.pdf#:~:text=9,On)  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update, see https://watttieder.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VenturaCounty-Public-Health-Officer-Order-June-28-2021.pdf#:~:text=Effective%20June%2015%2C%202021%2C%20the,Home)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order, June 15, 2021  
  Summary: The “Stay Well at Home” order issued on March 20, 2020 required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs or employment at designated essential businesses. It effectively brought nearly all in‑person operations to a halt throughout the county—including those affecting Camarillo—and set the groundwork for a series of local modifications as the pandemic evolved. Although subsequent orders allowed for partial reopenings, many of the operational restrictions originated from this order persisted indirectly into Q3 2020. The reason for its prolonged influence was that COVID‑19 case numbers remained high, meaning that even when the strict order was relaxed, its framework (including reduced capacities and safety protocols) continued to shape business operations.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – *Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols*  
  Order Dates:  
  – March 31, 2020: Extended Stay Well at Home order through April 19, 2020 (Source: https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20March%2031%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,framework%20is%20based%20upon%20the)  
  – April 9, 2020: Updated to add a gathering ban and safety protocols (Source: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=to%20help%20licensees%20with%20economic,19)  
  – April 20, 2020: Further extended the Stay Well at Home order through May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: These orders were superseded by the May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order which aligned local measures with state reopening guidelines  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order issued May 7, 2020  
  Summary: Throughout early 2020, Ventura County updated its Stay Well at Home order several times to respond to evolving conditions. On March 31, 2020, the order was extended to provide additional time for compliance. On April 9, 2020, the order was revised to ban all gatherings beyond a single household and require that essential businesses implement rigorous social distancing protocols. A further update on April 20, 2020 extended the restrictions into May. Although these specific orders were later replaced by a new reopening framework, the legacy of enhanced safety protocols (such as mandatory distancing and mask use) continued to affect business operations in Q3 2020 by establishing strict operating conditions even as businesses gradually reopened.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – *Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)*  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020, with an amendment on May 20, 2020 (Sources: See documents referenced from https://aagla.org/ and https://www.portofhueneme.org/coronavirus-update/#:~:text=May%2021%2C%202020…)  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint (August 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 state reopening  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order issued August 31, 2020 (aligning the county to the state Blueprint) and ultimately by the state’s June 15, 2021 order  
  Summary: In early May 2020, as California signaled an initial reopening phase, Ventura County’s Health Officer issued the “Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” order. The May 7 order repealed the stricter April restrictions and allowed the county to align its reopening with the state’s Stage 2 guidelines. This permitted certain businesses—especially lower‑risk sectors like retail offering curbside pickup and supporting manufacturing—to resume operations, though with strict safety protocols. On May 20, 2020, an amendment further allowed dine‑in restaurants and in‑store retail to reopen with precautions. This measure was critical for Q3 2020 because it established the reopening baseline for Camarillo businesses, even though later a summer surge led to additional restrictions.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – *Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)*  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020; Source: https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County)  
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (the order expired after its designated holiday weekend)  
  Rescinded By: The order expired based on its terms  
  Summary: In anticipation of heavy crowds during the Independence Day weekend amid increasing COVID‑19 cases, Ventura County ordered beaches closed and prohibited use of beach parking lots for that weekend. Although the order was short‑term, it directly affected local tourism and related business activity. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020—while Camarillo is inland, many residents and visitors who might travel to nearby coastal areas found their spending affected by these closures—this measure served as a reminder of how quickly restrictions could be re‑instated in response to rising cases.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – *Local Implementation of State Rollback*  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020; Source: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=OFFICER%20,are%20hereby)  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved to Tier 2)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020 that allowed certain indoor operations to resume and explicitly rescinded parts of the July 13 order  
  Summary: In response to the state’s July 13 statewide rollback of reopenings, Ventura County issued a local order to enforce these renewed closures across the county. This order re‑closed indoor operations for many sectors (gyms, churches, personal care services, etc.) that had been permitted to operate in June. For Camarillo businesses—particularly those in personal service industries—this order meant that any progress made during early summer was abruptly curtailed in July. As a result, many businesses had a second round of closures or severe restrictions during Q3 2020. The order’s necessity stemmed from a fresh surge in COVID‑19 cases that forced local authorities to tighten restrictions once again.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – *Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020*  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020 (Source: https://vcportal.ventura.org/CEO/VCNC/VC_Public_Health_Officer_Order_10-06-2020.pdf#:~:text=one%20based%20on%20a%20monitoring,that%20the%20current%20public%20health)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (effectively superseded by the December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and then by a return to the Purple tier in January 2021; note that ultimately all county orders were nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening)  
  Rescinded By: Effectively, the December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order; formally, by the state’s June 15, 2021 order ending all local tiered restrictions  
  Summary: By October 2020, Ventura County’s COVID‑19 numbers had improved sufficiently for the county to move from the most restrictive Purple tier to the less stringent Red tier. The October 6 order allowed certain businesses to reopen indoor operations under strict protocols. For example, gyms/fitness centers, houses of worship, and personal care services were permitted to operate indoors at reduced capacity. Although this easing came at the very end of Q3 2020 (and the full benefit was seen in Q4), it marked the first significant relief from the summer’s extended closures. For many Camarillo businesses, especially those that had endured nearly complete indoor shutdowns during July and August 2020, the approaching easing provided hope and a gradual return to more “normal” operations—albeit still under tight restrictions.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – *Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)*  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020; Sources: https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VC_Roadmap_to_Reopening_rev052120f.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20May%2012%2C%202020%20%E2%80%93,A%20Social%20Distancing%20Protocol%20Form and https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=)  
  Date Rescinded: September 30, 2020 for commercial evictions; for residential, replaced by state law via AB 3088 effective September 1, 2020  
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; Ventura County’s commercial eviction moratorium was extended by the Board through September 30, 2020  
  Summary: To help both business and residential tenants facing severe revenue losses, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors passed Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 on April 22, 2020, which temporarily prohibited evictions for tenants unable to pay rent due to COVID‑19–induced financial hardship. This protection applied to both residential and small‑business commercial tenants within unincorporated Ventura County. For businesses in Camarillo that rented commercial spaces, this measure offered critical relief by deferring rental arrears during a period when revenues were drastically reduced. Although the protection did not cancel rent obligations but merely delayed them, it provided a crucial buffer that helped many tenants survive the economic downturn experienced in Q3 2020.

  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20‑36 on March 13, 2020; Source: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=capacity%20as%20the%20City%20of,of%20the%20City%20Council%20at)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–2021 (remained in effect into 2021; officially ended in April 2022, outside this timeframe)  
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022)  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID‑19. This declaration, issued by City Manager Dave Norman as EOC Director and ratified by the City Council, activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed immediate deployment of emergency measures. It led to the closure of all public city facilities and the cancellation of public events (for example, City Hall, libraries, and community centers were closed). In Q3 2020, this emergency status was still in place, ensuring that the city could continue to enforce COVID‑19–related regulations that affected local businesses through measures such as streamlined outdoor permitting and ongoing safety directives.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – *Citywide Moratorium on Evictions*  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (March 18, 2020) and its Amendment (April 23, 2020) (Source: https://members.aagla.org/news/temporary-eviction-moratoriums--novel-coronavirus-covid-19#:~:text=Camarillo)  
  Date Enacted: Initially on March 18, 2020, and amended on April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law on September 2020 for residential evictions; for commercial, the order expired with the end of the local emergency  
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, the order was preempted by the California COVID‑19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on August 31, 2020; for any remaining commercial protections, the measure ended when the city's emergency designation was terminated  
  Summary: To shield tenants from immediate eviction during the severe revenue losses caused by the pandemic, Camarillo issued an eviction moratorium beginning on March 18, 2020. This order, later amended on April 23, extended protection to both residential and commercial tenants within the city limits, ensuring that landlords could not evict tenants for non‑payment if they were experiencing financial hardship due to COVID‑19. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 that were struggling to cover rent, this measure provided a vital delay that allowed them to continue operating without the immediate risk of eviction. It served as an essential economic lifeline in addition to the broader public health steps.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – *Temporary Outdoor Dining Program*  
  Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020 (passed in early June 2020; Source: https://cms7files.revize.com/camarilloca/Departments/Community%20Development/Applications/Reso%202020-63.pdf#:~:text=RESOLUTION%20NO.%202020,19)  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID‑19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the duration of the local emergency)  
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local COVID emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022  
  Summary: In an effort to support local restaurants facing the inability to offer full indoor dining duty during the pandemic, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020‑63. This emergency resolution waived typical zoning requirements and fees to allow restaurants to establish temporary outdoor dining spaces in areas such as parking lots and sidewalks. As a result, during Q3 2020—particularly in the wake of renewed indoor closures in July—restaurants that had set up outdoor dining areas were able to continue operations, albeit at reduced capacity. This measure was critical for many dining establishments, helping them generate some revenue and retain staff until full indoor service could resume.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – *Additional Camarillo Actions*  
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring to summer)  
  Summary: Besides the major orders detailed above, the City of Camarillo implemented several supplementary measures to support local businesses during the pandemic. Examples include suspending late fees on business taxes, streamlining permit processes by moving them online (thereby reducing the need for in‑person interactions), and promoting take‑out dining initiatives to support restaurants. Although these actions were not formal “orders,” they were essential components of Camarillo’s broader COVID‑19 response framework, which significantly altered how local businesses operated during Q3 2020.
