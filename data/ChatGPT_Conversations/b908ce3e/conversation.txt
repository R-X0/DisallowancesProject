COVID Orders Business Impact

# COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID-19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order name/number, enactment and rescission dates, any superseding orders, and a summary of its provisions and its specific impact on businesses (with emphasis on Q3 2020).

──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID-19”
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 [【43†L106-L115】]
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021 [【43†L106-L115】])
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the 2020–2021 scope)
  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. While it did not itself mandate business closures, it set the stage for aggressive public health measures. In Q3 2020, Camarillo businesses were still operating under the auspices of this ongoing national emergency – meaning federal support (e.g. stimulus aid) was available, but also that strict state/local health orders (empowered by the emergency) continued to limit business operations. The continuation of the national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic in Q3 2020, explaining why businesses remained under restrictions during that quarter.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)
  Rescinded By: Court order (April 18, 2022) ended the CDC travel mask mandate (outside 2020–2021)
  
  Summary: Although not directly a business closure, the new administration in early 2021 imposed federal mask-wearing requirements for interstate travel. President Biden’s executive order and a follow-on CDC order required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this had no direct effect (as it began in 2021), but it reflects the continuing federal response into 2021. The reason these mandates came about – and would later affect travel-related businesses – was the persisting pandemic conditions. By mid-2021, as vaccines rolled out, the federal focus shifted to safe operation protocols (like mask rules) rather than blanket closures, but the Q3 2020 business environment was still one of more severe state/local restrictions rather than federal mandates on private businesses.

Federal Note: The primary COVID-related restrictions on Camarillo businesses in 2020 were driven by state and local orders. Federal action mainly provided emergency declarations and guidance (enabling funding and setting health recommendations). By Q3 2020, no nationwide lockdown was in place – instead, California’s state orders (backed by the national emergency) governed business operations.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID-19 State of Emergency”
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 [【45†L72-L80】]
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (state of emergency remained active throughout 2020–21)
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by Governor’s proclamation (beyond 2021)
  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s March 4, 2020 proclamation declared a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19 [【45†L72-L80】]. This emergency status empowered the Governor and health authorities to issue sweeping orders affecting businesses (e.g. suspending certain laws, mobilizing resources, and later imposing lockdowns). In Q3 2020, this emergency was still in effect, underpinning all California COVID orders. For businesses, the ongoing state of emergency meant extraordinary measures (like fast-changing health directives, regulatory relief, and funding assistance) were authorized. The existence of a statewide emergency throughout 2020 was a key reason that stringent public health orders continued in Q3 2020 – the crisis conditions legally justified keeping restrictions on businesses to protect public health.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – “Statewide ‘Stay-at-Home’ Order”
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 [【47†L31-L39】] (effective immediately)
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [【58†L1-L4】]
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home effective 6/15/2021 [【58†L1-L4】]. Also superseded by later phased reopening orders.
  
  Summary: This was California’s sweeping lockdown order at the start of the pandemic. It ordered all individuals in California to stay at home except for essential needs and work in critical infrastructure sectors [【47†L31-L39】]. It forced “non-essential” businesses (like dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, theaters, etc.) to close or shift to minimum basic operations, while “essential” businesses (food stores, pharmacies, banks, etc.) could remain open with precautions. In Q3 2020, the direct effects of this March order had evolved – by that summer, California was gradually reopening some sectors – but many businesses in Camarillo were still operating under constraints that stemmed from this original shutdown. For example, retail shops and restaurants in Q3 2020 were only allowed limited operations (outdoor or reduced capacity) because the state had not yet fully lifted the stay-home mandate. The order’s continuation (it was in force “until further notice” [【47†L33-L41】]) reflected the sustained risk; it was only lifted once vaccines and case trends improved by mid-2021 [【20†L63-L70】]. The presence of this order (and its modifying successors) in Q3 2020 meant businesses were still far from normal – it explains why, that quarter, many Camarillo businesses were either closed or severely limited in service.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)”
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order per EO N-60-20) [【18†L39-L47】]
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [【22†L407-L414】] (superseded by the Beyond Blueprint Order)
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021), §5, which formally superseded the May 7, 2020 order [【22†L407-L414】].
  
  Summary: As COVID case rates plateaued in spring 2020, California began “Stage 2” of reopening. Consistent with Governor Newsom’s Resilience Roadmap, the State Public Health Officer issued this May 7 order to relax the March stay-home restrictions [【18†L39-L47】]. It allowed lower-risk businesses to reopen with modifications: for example, retail stores (clothing, bookstores, florists, etc.) could offer curbside pickup, and manufacturing supply chains for those retailers could resume [【29†L459-L467】]. However, higher-risk establishments (dine-in restaurants, gyms, salons, etc.) remained closed at that stage. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, this Stage 2 order was part of the gradual reopening that led into summer – by July, many local retailers were operating (at least in curbside or limited-capacity modes) thanks to the Stage 2 easing. The rationale was to revive economic activity while still controlling spread. However, because COVID surged in summer 2020, these initial reopenings were soon paused or reversed (see July order below), which significantly affected businesses in Q3 2020 – many had to scale back operations again just weeks after reopening, underscoring the tenuous situation that quarter.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 [【18†L49-L57】]
  Date Rescinded: Superseded August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021 [【22†L407-L414】]
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (Aug. 28, 2020) effectively replaced these closures with a tier system; and later the June 15, 2021 Beyond Blueprint Order terminated all remaining July 13 restrictions [【22†L407-L414】].
  
  Summary: In July 2020, California experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. In response, the State Health Officer re-imposed lockdown measures on previously reopened sectors. Statewide, this July 13 order closed many indoor operations that had been allowed in Stage 2: for example, restaurants had to shut indoor dining (outdoor and take-out were allowed), bars, breweries and movie theaters were closed, and museums/zoos were closed again indoors [【18†L49-L57】]. Additionally, counties on the state’s monitoring list (areas with the worst outbreaks, which included Ventura County) had to close indoor operations for gyms, places of worship, non-critical offices, personal care services (nail salons, tattoo parlors), and malls [【18†L49-L57】]. This had a major impact in Q3 2020: Camarillo businesses that had reopened in May/June had to partially or fully close again in July. For example, restaurants in Camarillo during Q3 2020 could only offer outdoor dining or takeout, and gyms and salons were forced shut for the remainder of the summer. These renewed restrictions in the middle of Q3 dramatically cut business revenues and operations. The reason for this rollback was the “significant increase in the spread of COVID-19” in California [【18†L49-L57】] – essentially, the summer surge forced the state to hit the “emergency brake,” directly affecting businesses in that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color-Tier Reopening System”
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) [【51†L68-L76】]
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 [【22†L407-L414】]
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order, effective 6/15/2021, which superseded the August 28, 2020 order and retired the tier system [【22†L407-L414】].
  
  Summary: California unveiled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on Aug. 28, 2020 as a long-term, color-coded tier system for COVID-19 restrictions [【51†L68-L76】]. This new framework replaced the blunt monitoring-list closures with a graduated, risk-based approach. Every county was assigned a tier (Purple = widespread risk, Red = substantial, Orange = moderate, Yellow = minimal) based on local case rates and positivity%. Each tier set specific rules for businesses: e.g. in Purple tier (the most restrictive), many non-essential indoor business operations were prohibited, whereas in Red or Orange tiers, certain indoor operations could open with capacity limits [【51†L65-L72】【51†L88-L96】]. Ventura County (and thus Camarillo) entered the Blueprint in the Purple tier on Aug 31, 2020, since case rates were high [【9†L13-L21】【9†L15-L23】]. In Q3 2020, this meant that although the blanket July closures were lifted, most Camarillo businesses still faced heavy restrictions: retail stores could open indoors with limited capacity, but indoor dining, gyms, and movie theaters remained closed in Purple tier (only outdoor or take-home services allowed). As conditions improved, Ventura County moved into the Red tier by October, easing some rules. The Blueprint’s purpose was to provide a predictable structure: it gradually reopened businesses in Q3/Q4 2020 when COVID metrics improved, but also allowed tightening if metrics worsened [【51†L65-L72】]. For a Camarillo business in Q3 2020, the Blueprint meant their operating status was tied to Ventura County’s tier – and during that quarter the county was mostly in the most restrictive tier, explaining why many businesses were still severely limited. The tier system remained in effect until statewide vaccinations and declining cases enabled California to “retire” the Blueprint on June 15, 2021 [【20†L63-L70】], at which point nearly all business restrictions were lifted.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; triggered in SoCal region Dec 6, 2020) [【59†L55-L63】【59†L75-L83】]
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 [【54†L355-L363】]
  Rescinded By: State Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the Regional Stay-at-Home Order statewide (Jan. 25, 2021) once ICU projections improved [【54†L355-L363】].
  
  Summary: In late 2020, facing a dire winter COVID surge, California introduced the Regional Stay-at-Home Order – a stricter lockdown tied to ICU (intensive care unit) capacity. Ventura County is part of the Southern California region, which fell below the 15% ICU availability threshold on Dec. 4, 2020 [【59†L55-L63】], triggering this order. The Regional Order essentially pulled counties back to full shutdown if their region’s hospitals were in crisis. It required the closure of many business sectors, both indoor and outdoor: e.g. restaurants had to stop outdoor dining (take-out only), personal care services (hair and nail salons) closed entirely, movie theaters, museums, and amusement centers closed, and retail stores had to further reduce capacity (down to 20%) [【59†L81-L90】【59†L101-L109】]. This was the most stringent measure since the spring. Although this order took effect in Q4 2020, its impact carried into early Q1 2021, and it highlighted the precarious situation businesses faced. (By Q3 2020, businesses might have hoped the worst was over, but the emergence of this order in December showed that restrictions could return if conditions worsened.) Q3 2020 itself was not directly under the Regional Stay-at-Home Order, but the looming threat of a resurgent virus (which materialized in winter) meant businesses remained cautious. The Regional Order was lifted on Jan. 25, 2021 when ICU forecasts improved, putting Ventura County back into the Purple tier system. The existence of this emergency brake mechanism is a reminder of why Q3 2020 business conditions were tenuous – the pandemic’s trajectory was uncertain, and even a quarter later businesses would face another round of closures due to factors (ICU strain) that were already a concern in mid-2020.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – “Termination of Stay-at-Home/Tiers”
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; health order effective June 15, 2021) [【20†L63-L70】【22†L407-L414】]
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order ended prior orders)
  Rescinded By: This order itself rescinded the remaining COVID business restrictions. (California’s underlying state of emergency continued, but without the business closures/tier framework.)
  
  Summary: This pair of orders (Governor’s EO and a State Health Officer Order) marked California’s full reopening on June 15, 2021. They formally terminated the March 2020 Stay-at-Home Order (EO N-33-20) and “retired” the Blueprint tier system statewide [【20†L63-L70】【58†L1-L4】]. Practically, it lifted capacity limits, physical distancing requirements, and most other COVID-related operating restrictions on businesses. After this date, Camarillo businesses could generally operate at pre-pandemic levels (subject only to any remaining mask rules or industry-specific guidance). In the context of Q3 2020, this June 2021 milestone highlights how far into the future the restrictions persisted. The fact that California did not fully lift business constraints until mid-2021 underscores why Q3 2020 was heavily impacted – businesses spent that quarter under evolving but continued rules, awaiting a normalcy that came roughly three quarters later. The reason this “Beyond the Blueprint” order could be issued was improving public health metrics (dropping cases and widespread vaccinations by spring 2021), which were absent in Q3 2020 – thus, businesses in mid-2020 had to contend with the stricter earlier orders until conditions allowed this final reopening.

Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 [【38†L19-L27】]
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2020–21 (county emergency remained in effect; ultimately ended in 2022)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the COVID-19 emergency (March 2022, beyond our scope)
  
  Summary: Ventura County’s Public Health Officer, Dr. Robert Levin, declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020 in response to COVID-19 [【38†L19-L27】]. This was quickly ratified by county authorities. The declaration itself didn’t impose restrictions on businesses, but it provided the legal basis for the County Health Officer to issue health orders and for the county to coordinate emergency resources. By establishing that a health emergency existed locally, it allowed Ventura County to mirror and enforce state orders (like shelter-in-place) and to act swiftly in targeting local outbreak conditions. For Q3 2020, this emergency status was still active, meaning Ventura County had the ongoing authority to issue local rules affecting Camarillo businesses. The local emergency’s continuation into late 2020 was due to the sustained threat of COVID-19 – it justified why the county could keep certain local rules (like mask recommendations or enforcement of state directives) in place, thereby impacting businesses throughout the quarter.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  Order Date: March 17, 2020 [【61†L78-L83】]
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 [【61†L95-L102】] (and later formally repealed by subsequent orders)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020, which supplemented and expanded this order [【61†L95-L102】]
  
  Summary: Prior to the statewide stay-at-home directive, Ventura County issued its own early restrictions. The March 17, 2020 health officer order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain businesses and public facilities until at least April 2, 2020 [【61†L78-L83】]. In practice, this meant that even before Newsom’s statewide mandate, Ventura County had shut down venues like bars, nightclubs, gyms, and movie theaters, and limited restaurants to take-out only. This local order was quickly eclipsed by the more comprehensive March 19 state order, and the county rolled it into a broader local stay-home order on March 20. However, it set the tone for aggressive local action. By Q3 2020, the specifics of the March 17 order had long been overtaken by later rules, but its legacy was that Ventura County did not hesitate to impose stricter measures if needed. The early timing shows the county’s proactive approach, which continued through 2020. The reason this order came about was immediate concern over COVID-19 spread in mid-March – and that same concern persisted into Q3, explaining why Ventura County remained vigilant with local enforcement of health measures.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay-Home Order”
  Order Date: March 20, 2020 [【61†L95-L102】]
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (implicitly by alignment with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update ending local restrictions [【7†L29-L35】【9†L27-L35】])
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order June 15, 2021, which noted the end of the Governor’s stay-home order and lifted remaining local restrictions [【7†L29-L35】]
  
  Summary: Ventura County’s “Stay Well at Home” order, issued March 20, 2020, was the local companion to California’s statewide stay-home mandate. It required all Ventura County residents to stay at their residences except for essential needs or employment at essential businesses [【61†L95-L102】]. This county lockdown made the state’s directives enforceable at the local level and added county-specific provisions (such as definitions of essential businesses and local enforcement mechanisms). Under this order, virtually all Camarillo businesses had to cease in-person operations unless they were deemed essential (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, and healthcare providers) [【61†L95-L102】]. Although the order was initially set with a deadline of April 19, 2020 and extended several times, many of its core restrictions continued to impact operations in Q3 2020 indirectly. For example, even if the strict stay-home was not in full force by July, capacity limits and partial closures (derived from this order’s framework) still applied. The reason this order’s framework persisted through Q3 was that COVID-19 cases remained significant – the county could not lift the order without replacement rules until the public health situation improved. Thus, Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020 continued to face major restrictions as a legacy of the county-wide “Stay Well at Home” order.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
  Order Dates:
    – March 31, 2020 (extended Stay-Home to 4/19/2020) [【6†L73-L77】]
    – April 9, 2020 (added gathering ban & safety protocols) [【13†L49-L57】【13†L39-L47】]
    – April 20, 2020 (further extended Stay-Home through 5/15/2020) [【61†L95-L102】【61†L78-L83】]
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond); fully repealed by the May 7, 2020 order that aligned with state regulations [【61†L99-L107】]
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order May 7, 2020 which replaced the April orders with the “Safely Reopening” order in line with the state roadmap.
  
  Summary: Throughout spring 2020, Ventura County periodically updated its stay-home order. On March 31, 2020 the order was extended. Then on April 9, 2020, as cases surged, an updated order prohibited all gatherings (outside a single household) and required essential businesses still open to implement social distancing measures (e.g. posting COVID safety plans, ensuring 6-foot distancing). An April 20, 2020 order further tightened definitions and continued stay-home requirements into May. While these specific orders were no longer active by Q3 2020 (having been replaced by the reopening framework), they established the baseline for the safety measures—such as distancing and mask requirements—that remained in effect when businesses reopened. Their origin in the spring explains why Q3 2020 businesses had to operate with reduced throughput and increased operating costs.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (amendment) [【6†L64-L72】【29†L437-L445】]
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint (Aug. 31, 2020) and later by the June 15, 2021 state order ending all local restrictions.
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order Aug. 31, 2020 (aligning the county with the state’s Blueprint Tier 1) and ultimately by the June 15, 2021 state order.
  
  Summary: In early May 2020, as California signaled reopening, Ventura County issued the “Stay Well VC – Safely Reopening” order. The May 7, 2020 order repealed earlier stricter orders and allowed movement to align with the state’s Phase 2 reopening starting May 8. Then, on May 20, 2020, after receiving state approval for an “accelerated Stage 2” variance, the order was amended to allow dine-in restaurants and in-store retail (with precautions). As a result, by late May many Camarillo restaurants reopened for dine-in service under limited conditions and shopping centers could open at reduced capacity. For Q3 2020, these orders meant many businesses were open—albeit with strict safety rules—but they also set the stage for subsequent reversals (such as the July 13 statewide rollback) when the summer surge hit. The Safely Reopening order required businesses to implement prevention plans such as social distancing and mask use. Its effect was to enable a cautious economic revival in Q3 2020 under conditions that still posed considerable challenges.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (announced for July 3–5, 2020) [【39†L5-L12】]
  Date Rescinded: July 6, 2020 (order was limited to the Independence Day weekend)
  Rescinded By: The order expired by its own terms after July 5, 2020.
  
  Summary: Anticipating crowding over the Independence Day weekend amid rising COVID cases, Ventura County’s health officer ordered beaches closed and beach parking lots off-limits for the July 4, 2020 weekend [【39†L5-L12】]. This short-term measure aimed to prevent super-spreader events. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, particularly those involved in tourism or serving visitors from coastal areas, this meant a temporary curtailment of revenue during what would normally be a busy holiday period. Although Camarillo itself is inland, fewer visitors to nearby beaches indirectly reduced holiday spending. This example shows that even targeted, short-term closures contributed to the overall challenging business climate in Q3 2020.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) [【9†L31-L39】]
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (partially rescinded as the county moved to Tier 2) [【9†L31-L39】]
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order Oct. 6, 2020 allowed certain indoor operations to reopen and explicitly rescinded parts of the July 13 order.
  
  Summary: Following Governor Newsom’s July 13 statewide closures, Ventura County issued a local order implementing those restrictions. The order re-closed indoor operations for sectors including gyms, fitness centers, houses of worship, and personal care services in line with the statewide rollback [【9†L33-L39】]. This meant that for Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo such as fitness studios, churches, nail salons, and tattoo parlors—many of which had reopened in June—had to shut indoor services again in July. Some businesses that could operate outdoors managed to continue some form of service. The order remained until improvements in Ventura County’s COVID metrics in the fall allowed a partial reopening on October 6. For many sectors in Q3 2020, the renewed closures led to significant revenue loss and operational strain. The rollback was forced by the summer case surge.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  Order Date: October 6, 2020 [【9†L13-L21】【9†L31-L39】]
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (after subsequent orders like the Regional Stay-at-Home Order in Dec 2020 and later return to Purple tier in Jan 2021)
  Rescinded By: Effectively superseded by the Dec. 2020 Regional Stay-at-Home Order; formally, all county orders were nullified by the state’s June 15, 2021 reopening.
  
  Summary: By early October 2020, Ventura County’s COVID metrics allowed the county to move from the Purple to the Red tier. The October 6 order permitted specified businesses—gyms/fitness centers, houses of worship, personal care services—to reopen indoor operations under strict protocols [【9†L15-L23】]. For a Camarillo business toward the end of Q3 2020, this announced an imminent easing of restrictions after months of near-total closures or outdoor-only operations. Although it marked a transition from the heavy restrictions of July, the order came as a last-minute relief before winter measures returned in December. It illustrates how Q3 2020 business owners were caught in a cycle of reopening and re-closure as conditions fluctuated.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial urgency ordinance passed March 31, 2020 [【66†L144-L150】])
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; for residential, replaced by state law (from Sept 1, 2020 via AB 3088)
  Rescinded By: For residential tenants, superseded by the California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) on Aug. 31, 2020; Ventura County’s commercial protection expired per local records.
  
  Summary: Recognizing the financial hardship caused by COVID-19, Ventura County’s Board of Supervisors passed an urgency ordinance (No. 4563) to temporarily prevent landlord evictions of both residential and small-business commercial tenants unable to pay rent due to COVID-related losses [【30†L9-L17】; also see [【31†L33-L40】]. In Q3 2020, while state law took over residential protections, the commercial eviction moratorium remained in effect until September 30, 2020. This measure provided crucial relief for struggling Camarillo businesses by delaying evictions and giving them time to recover, even though it did not reduce rent owed. Its purpose was to prevent a cascade of evictions that could worsen the public health and economic crisis.

City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 [【38†L29-L37】] (ratified by City Council Resolution No. 20-36 on March 13, 2020)
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (local emergency remained in effect into 2021; officially lifted in 2022)
  Rescinded By: Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022, outside our timeframe)
  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID-19 through EOC Director Order No. 20-1, ratified by the City Council [【38†L29-L37】]. This activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and allowed for rapid deployment of resources and response measures, including closures of city facilities and cancellation of public events. For Camarillo businesses, the declaration meant that the city had the authority to offer regulatory relief (for example, streamlined permitting for outdoor operations) and to enforce COVID-related rules, all of which affected economic activity in Q3 2020.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and Amendment (April 23, 2020) [【35†L218-L222】]
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (amended April 23, 2020)
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law on Aug. 31, 2020 for residential tenants and eventually ended with the local emergency for any remaining commercial provisions.
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (Tenant Relief Act) on Aug. 31, 2020, preempting local measures; formally terminated when the City ended its emergency (2022).
  
  Summary: The City of Camarillo acted early to protect its residents and local businesses by issuing an eviction moratorium (Order No. 20-2, amended April 23, 2020) that prohibited evictions for nonpayment of rent due to COVID-19-induced financial hardship [【35†L218-L222】]. This local measure paralleled county protections but applied specifically within Camarillo. In Q3 2020, for any businesses renting space in the city that had suffered revenue losses, this order provided temporary relief by delaying evictions and allowing time for recovery.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020 (passed in early June 2020)
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021 when full indoor dining resumed; formally tied to the local emergency duration)
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local COVID emergency ended and normal zoning rules were reinstated in 2021/2022.
  
  Summary: To assist restaurants in coping with restrictions on indoor dining, the Camarillo City Council adopted Resolution 2020-63 in June 2020. This emergency measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees to facilitate temporary outdoor dining areas on parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces [【38†L2-L8】; see also [【13†L51-L59】]. In Q3 2020, many restaurants in Camarillo relied on these outdoor setups once indoor dining was again restricted by state orders. This allowed them to continue serving customers under safe, socially distanced conditions. The resolution was a crucial step for sustaining local eateries during the pandemic by permitting economic activity despite strict indoor restrictions.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring to summer)
  
  Summary: In addition to the major orders above, the City of Camarillo implemented other supportive measures during the COVID-19 crisis. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online so that construction and development could proceed with minimal in-person contact, and promoting take-out dining campaigns to support local restaurants. City code enforcement also worked in coordination with Ventura County regarding compliance with health orders. Such measures, although not “orders” per se, formed an integral part of Camarillo’s overall response framework that influenced business operations in Q3 2020.

Overall Analysis

Across federal, state, county and city levels, the COVID-19 response created a complex and evolving regulatory environment for Camarillo businesses during 2020–2021. Q3 2020 in particular was characterized by:
– Continued reliance on the national emergency declaration and the state’s Stay-at-Home and subsequent reopening orders.
– Frequent adjustments by Ventura County in response to surging or declining case rates (with orders in July tighting restrictions and early October orders beginning to ease them).
– Local measures in Camarillo such as its emergency declaration, eviction moratoriums, and adaptations (like the outdoor dining program) designed both to enforce public health and to mitigate economic fallout.

The interplay of these orders meant that even as businesses tried to reopen and operate, they faced renewed closures and capacity limits on multiple occasions. For instance, restaurants might open in May or June under “Safely Reopening” orders only to have indoor dining shut down again in July due to a summer surge. At the same time, eviction protections and local emergency measures provided critical – though temporary – support.
