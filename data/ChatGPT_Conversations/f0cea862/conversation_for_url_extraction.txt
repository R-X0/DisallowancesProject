COVID-19 Orders Affecting Camarillo Businesses (2020–2021)
──────────────────────────────
•  Federal Orders

– Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; later officially terminated by Congress in 2023)  
  Rescinded by: A later Congressional action (outside the 2020–2021 timeframe)  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a national emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. This declaration activated federal emergency powers and unlocked funding meant to support state and local responses and set the stage for aggressive public health measures. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it provided the legal basis and urgency that later allowed state and local entities to impose restrictions. In Q3 2020, while federal directives were not directly closing businesses, the ongoing national emergency underscored the serious context in which local health orders were being enforced—affecting how businesses operated and the availability of federal support (such as stimulus aid).

– CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective Feb. 1, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (remained in effect throughout 2021; lifted in 2022 by court order)  
  Rescinded by: A court order on April 18, 2022  
  Summary: Although not affecting every business directly, early in 2021 the federal government introduced mask mandates for interstate travel (airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties). These requirements, set forth by President Biden’s executive order and a subsequent CDC order, formed part of the broader federal response to ensure that travel—an important aspect of economic activity—remained as safe as possible. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, these mandates had no direct operational effect since they began in 2021; however, they reflected how federal policy was evolving from blanket restrictions toward more targeted measures as vaccine rollouts began. This also indicated a gradual shift towards reopening and a change in priorities in the federal strategy as local measures remained the primary mechanism during Q3 2020.

•  California State Orders

– State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained active throughout the period)  
  Rescinded by: Ended February 28, 2023 by a subsequent proclamation  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on March 4, 2020 to mobilize resources and provide the legal framework for subsequent public health and business restrictions. This proclamation enabled the state to bypass certain regulatory barriers and grant emergency powers to impose severe restrictions when needed, including business closures and capacity limitations. For Q3 2020 businesses in Camarillo, the continued state of emergency meant that all later health orders and lockdown measures were backed by this status, providing legal justification for ongoing operational restrictions. It also signaled to the public and businesses that extraordinary measures were warranted by the crisis.

– Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded by: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021) which terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home order effective 6/15/2021  
  Summary: This sweeping order mandated that all Californians remain at home except for essential tasks and work in critical sectors. It directly forced non-essential businesses in the state—including those in Camarillo—to close or drastically reduce in-person operations. For businesses in Q3 2020, while the most stringent parts of the order were gradually moderated through phased reopenings, its legacy was evident in the continued limitations on indoor operations (e.g., limited capacity or outdoor-only dining). The order underscores why many businesses in Q3 2020 were still operating under partial or modified restrictions, as the full reopening did not occur until mid-2021.

– State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (State Health Officer order issued under EO N-60-20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (formally replaced by the “Beyond Blueprint Order”)  
  Rescinded by: State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Summary: As the state’s pandemic curve began to flatten in the spring, California initiated Stage 2 of reopening. This order eased some of the restrictions imposed by the March stay-at-home order, allowing lower-risk businesses such as curbside retail operations to resume. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, this order marked the beginning of gradual reopening; however, many higher-risk operations (like in-dining at restaurants) remained closed or subject to strict capacity limitations. The order’s cautious approach was driven by the need to balance economic revival with public health safety – a balance that proved particularly challenging during the turbulent summer surge.

– State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the Blueprint tier framework; formally rescinded June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded by: State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the Beyond Blueprint Order  
  Summary: Following a sharp rise in cases during the summer surge, California re-imposed restrictions in July 2020. This order rolled back many of the earlier reopenings—mandating indoor closures for restaurants (except for takeout/outdoor service), gyms, breweries, and other non-essential indoor operations. For Q3 2020, this meant that many businesses in Camarillo that had cautiously reopened in May or early June were forced to close their indoor operations again in July. The rollback was a direct consequence of worsening local COVID-19 metrics and demonstrated the volatility of the reopening process during that quarter.

  Order details can be found in official state announcements and the July 13, 2020 Public Health Officer Order document.

– “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 (with the issuance of the Beyond Blueprint Order)  
  Rescinded by: State Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021  
  Summary: The Blueprint introduced a risk-based, color-coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) to regulate business operations more granularly. Ventura County, which includes Camarillo, was placed in the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that many indoor business activities were still prohibited. Although this system allowed for some gradual reopening as conditions improved, during Q3 2020 most businesses continued to face heavy restrictions. The reason for this approach was to provide a stable, data-driven framework that could react swiftly to changing public health conditions.

– “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Prior Restrictions  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Health Officer Order  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order ended previous restrictions)  
  Rescinded by: The order itself ended the earlier Stay-at-Home and Blueprint orders  
  Summary: Issued in mid-2021, this order marked the state’s full reopening by rescinding all remaining COVID-19 business restrictions imposed since March 2020. Its issuance highlighted how long stringent measures persisted—the rollback meant that business operations in Camarillo, previously constrained through Q3 2020, could finally resume normal activities. For Q3 2020, this order serves as a retrospective indicator of the prolonged restrictions that businesses had to work under and the public health conditions that only began to improve much later.

•  Ventura County Orders

– Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded by: A Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution in March 2022  
  Summary: Responding swiftly to COVID-19, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency on March 12, 2020. Although the declaration itself did not impose business restrictions, it provided the authority for subsequent county orders. This local emergency enabled county officials to enforce state orders rigorously and to introduce additional local measures when needed. For Q3 2020, the continued emergency status meant that Ventura County could sustain or reintroduce restrictions quickly if COVID-19 cases surged.

– Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the County’s “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020  
  Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer’s March 20, 2020 order  
  Summary: Even before the statewide stay-at-home approach was in full force, Ventura County issued its own early order on March 17, 2020. This order directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and mandated the closure of non-essential businesses and public venues. While it was soon incorporated into a broader local order, its early implementation set a precedent for the aggressive restrictions that followed, affecting how quickly businesses in Camarillo were forced to alter operations.
  Source Link:  
  (Official county health orders from early March 2020)

– “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-Home Order  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening; formally by Ventura County Health Officer’s June 15, 2021 update)  
  Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order (June 15, 2021)  
  Summary: This local order reinforced California’s statewide mandate by instructing all Ventura County residents to remain at home unless accessing essential services. It forced closure of virtually all non-essential in-person business operations in the county—including most businesses in Camarillo—thus severely curbing economic activity. Even as the order was modified for gradual reopening, its framework continued to influence business capacity limits and operational methods through Q3 2020, demonstrating the long-lasting impact of early lockdown strategies.

– Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates: March 31, 2020; April 9, 2020; April 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 and beyond)  
  Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020  
  Summary: Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County updated its initial stay-home order by extending its duration and introducing strict social distancing measures and gathering bans. These updates forced essential businesses to adopt safety protocols such as 6-foot distancing and posting of COVID-19 safety plans. Although these orders were replaced by a “Safely Reopening” plan in May, the protocols they established remained in effect through Q3 2020 and influenced how businesses (for example, retail stores and service providers) operated with reduced capacity and enhanced safety requirements.
  Source Link:  
  (See Ventura County orders issued on March 31, April 9, and April 20, 2020)

– “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and amended May 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state Blueprint Order on August 31, 2020 and later by June 15, 2021 reopening  
  Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 and ultimately the State’s June 15, 2021 Order  
  Summary: As pandemic conditions eased slightly in early May 2020, Ventura County issued an order to “safely reopen” businesses in line with state guidelines. The May 7 order repealed some of the stricter April restrictions, allowing critical retail and manufacturing businesses to resume operations with safety measures in place. An amendment on May 20 further allowed dine-in services and in-store retail under strict protocols. For Q3 2020, the reopening provided a temporary boost; however, businesses soon faced renewed closures in July when statewide rollbacks were implemented due to rising cases.

– Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)  
  Order Date: Announced June 30, 2020 (for July 3–5, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Automatically expired July 6, 2020  
  Rescinded by: The order was limited in time and ended after the holiday weekend  
  Summary: In anticipation of significant crowding during the Independence Day weekend and rising local case numbers, Ventura County ordered the closure of beaches and related parking lots for the July 4–5 weekend. Although this order chiefly targeted mass gatherings rather than business operations per se, it indirectly affected nearby tourism and recreation-related businesses. For Camarillo, even though it is inland, reduced visitor traffic in the region during the holiday meant less revenue for restaurants and retail outlets that normally benefit from increased patronage during holiday weekends.

– Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded October 6, 2020 as the county moved to Tier 2  
  Rescinded by: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020  
  Summary: In alignment with Governor Newsom’s statewide July 13 order, Ventura County issued its own directive mandating the re-closure of indoor operations for non-essential businesses such as gyms, fitness centers, places of worship, and personal care services. This order meant that many Camarillo businesses that had briefly reopened in late spring were forced to shut indoor operations again in July. The measure, driven by the summer surge in cases, had a pronounced economic impact in Q3 2020, especially on service industries that are hard to adapt to outdoor formats.

– Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (later affected by Regional Stay-At-Home Order in December 2020 and a return to Purple in January 2021)  
  Rescinded by: The change in tier status and subsequent state orders; ultimately county orders were nullified by the state’s full reopening on June 15, 2021  
  Summary: By early October 2020, improved local COVID-19 metrics allowed Ventura County to transition from the restrictive Purple tier to the less restrictive Red tier. The October 6 order permitted indoor reopening for certain sectors (gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services) under safety protocols. Although this provided relief for businesses towards the end of Q3 2020 (especially those that had been shuttered in July), the easing was short-lived before another surge forced stricter measures in December. For Q3, the order indicated the first signs of recovery after months of harsh restrictions.

– Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; passed March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, the protection lasted through September 30, 2020; for residential, later replaced by state law on August 31, 2020 via AB 3088  
  Rescinded by: The California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088) for residential tenants and local decisions for commercial evictions  
  Summary: Aimed at preventing small businesses and residents from being evicted amid dramatic revenue losses due to the pandemic, Ventura County imposed an eviction moratorium under Urgency Ordinance No. 4563. This temporary ban shielded both residential and, in many cases, commercial tenants from eviction due to nonpayment, although it did not forgive rent. For businesses in Q3 2020 in Camarillo, this measure provided critical, albeit temporary, economic relief by giving them time to recover without the immediate threat of losing their business premises.

•  City of Camarillo Orders

– Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded by: A Camarillo City Council resolution in April 2022  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local state of emergency, thereby activating its Emergency Operations Center and empowering the city to take swift measures. City facilities were closed and public events canceled to mitigate virus spread. For businesses in Q3 2020, the ongoing local emergency meant that the city retained the authority to impose or enforce additional rules—such as permitting outdoor dining zones or modifying municipal processes—to help mitigate the economic impact.
  Source Link:  
  (Official Camarillo City Council records and related city press releases)

– Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and its amendment (April 23, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: Initial order on March 18, 2020; amended April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded for residential tenants by California AB 3088 on August 31, 2020; commercial provisions eventually ended with the local emergency  
  Rescinded by: The California COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act and later the termination of the local emergency  
  Summary: Camarillo’s city government quickly acted to protect tenants by banning evictions for those unable to pay rent due to COVID-19 hardships. This protection applied to both residential and commercial tenants in the city, helping local businesses avoid abrupt shutdowns due to lease losses. For Q3 2020, this meant that a struggling business could delay rent payments without the immediate risk of eviction—alleviating one of the many economic pressures during the pandemic.

  (Documentation and press releases from Camarillo city officials, e.g., details of Order No. 20-2)

– Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: Approximately June 10, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Effectively expired with the end of COVID-19 capacity restrictions (around June 15, 2021)  
  Rescinded by: Automatic sunset as the local emergency ended and normal zoning rules were restored  
  Summary: Recognizing that indoor dining was severely restricted, Camarillo’s City Council passed Resolution 2020-63 to waive zoning requirements and fees for temporary outdoor dining setups. This allowed restaurants to quickly set up outdoor seating in parking lots, sidewalks, or other open spaces to continue serving customers safely. In Q3 2020, these outdoor dining areas were vital for many restaurants in Camarillo to generate revenue despite the ongoing indoor restrictions—a creative solution that balanced health concerns with economic survival.

– Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring to summer)  
  Summary: Besides the emergency declarations and eviction moratoria, the City of Camarillo enacted several supportive measures. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online to avoid in-person contact, and launching promotional campaigns (e.g., for take-out dining) intended to support local businesses during the crisis. Such actions, though not formal “orders,” contributed to the overall regulatory landscape that both restricted and aided Camarillo businesses throughout Q3 2020.

Additional Context:
The comprehensive compilation above reflects the multi-layered governmental response to COVID-19. At the federal level, emergency proclamations provided a backdrop for state and local actions. California’s orders—from the initial state of emergency and stay-at-home mandates to later reopening frameworks and rollbacks—directly governed how businesses, including those in Camarillo, could operate amid evolving public health conditions. Ventura County and the City of Camarillo added local orders (such as eviction moratoria and special outdoor dining provisions) designed to mitigate both the health crisis and its economic fallout. For Q3 2020, many businesses were caught in a cycle of partial reopening followed by renewed restrictions as case numbers fluctuated. These orders and associated measures collectively explain the challenging business climate during that quarter.
