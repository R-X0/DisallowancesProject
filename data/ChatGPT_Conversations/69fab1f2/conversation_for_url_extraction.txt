COVID Orders Business Impact

Below is a structured compilation of key federal, state, county, and city COVID‑19 orders, proclamations, and public health directives from 2020–2021 that impacted businesses in Camarillo, California. Each entry includes the order’s identifying number or name, enactment and rescission dates, any subsequent orders that superseded it, and a detailed summary explaining what the order entailed and its specific impact on businesses (with an emphasis on Q3 2020). Additionally, the text analyzes possible reasons these orders would have affected businesses during that quarter.

───────────────────────────────────────────────  
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – “National Emergency Concerning COVID‑19”
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (it remained in effect; later, the President extended it on February 24, 2021)  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (beyond the scope of 2020–2021)
  
  Summary:  
  On March 13, 2020, by Proclamation 9994, the President declared a national emergency due to the COVID‑19 outbreak (see source: The White House Notice on the Continuation of the National Emergency at “https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/02/24/notice-on-the-continuation-of-the-national-emergency-concerning-the-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=On%20March%2013%2C%202020%2C%20by,and%20safety%20of%20the%20Nation”). This declaration activated federal emergency powers and funding. Although it did not itself mandate the closure of businesses, it created the legal and policy context that supported later state and local restrictions. In Q3 2020, while businesses in Camarillo were dealing with state and county orders, the ongoing national emergency helped provide federal stimulus and guidance but also underscored the severity of the crisis.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – “Federal Mask Requirements for Travel”
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (via Executive Order 13998 on travel safety; CDC order effective February 1, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded in 2021 (it remained in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate
  
  Summary:
  Early in 2021, the new administration imposed federal mask‑wearing requirements on travel modes (airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and other federal properties). Although the order itself primarily affected travel and not local business operations in Camarillo during Q3 2020 (since it came into effect in 2021), it is part of the overall federal response to COVID‑19. In essence, while federal mandates shaped the national response to prevent virus spread, most of the direct impacts on Camarillo’s business operations in Q3 2020 came from state and local orders.

───────────────────────────────────────────────  
California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – “California COVID‑19 State of Emergency”
  Order Number: (No specific number; it is the Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (the state of emergency remained active throughout that period)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by a later proclamation
  
  Summary:
  On March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California (see details at “https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/#:~:text=SACRAMENTO%20%E2%80%93%20As%20part%20of,19%20death”). This declaration empowered state and local agencies to issue sweeping measures—such as closures and regulatory adjustments—that directly affected business operations. For businesses in Camarillo in Q3 2020, the maintained state of emergency provided both a legal basis for ongoing restrictions and later the eligibility for economic relief programs.

• Executive Order N‑33‑20 – “Statewide ‘Stay‑at‑Home’ Order”
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N‑07‑21 (June 11, 2021), which terminated the statewide Stay‑at‑Home Order and superseded earlier orders
  
  Summary:
  This order, issued on March 19, 2020, mandated that all residents of California remain at home except for essential needs, which forced non‑essential businesses (such as dine‑in restaurants, gyms, retail stores, and theaters) either to close or drastically reduce operations. Although by Q3 2020 the strictest restrictions had been partially eased and modified for a gradual reopening, many key limitations (such as limited indoor capacity) still stemmed from this original shutdown order. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses continued operating under the regime that evolved from this mandate, meaning that although some reopenings had occurred, capacity and service were still severely constrained due to the order’s legacy.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – “Modifying Stay‑at‑Home (Early Stage 2)”
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under Executive Order N‑60‑20)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: Later “Beyond Blueprint” orders (e.g. the June 11, 2021 order)
  
  Summary:
  With the intention of easing the initial strict lockdown, on May 7, 2020 the State Public Health Officer issued an order to transition into “Stage 2” reopening. This allowed lower‑risk businesses (such as many retail outlets and manufacturing support operations) to resume operations under strict health protocols, although high‑risk venues (like dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed. For Camarillo businesses, this marked the beginning of gradual reopening in the summer of 2020. However, due to a surge in cases later that summer, some of these relaxations were quickly rolled back in July, creating a volatile environment in Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – “Statewide Rollback of Reopening”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the “Blueprint Tier” framework and later formally rescinded on June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The subsequent State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later the June 15, 2021 order
  
  Summary:
  In response to a sharp increase in COVID‑19 cases during the summer, the state re‑imposed restrictions on previously reopened sectors. This rollback closed many indoor operations, including restaurants (which had to switch to outdoor dining or takeout only), bars, movie theaters, and other venues. For Camarillo businesses operating in Q3 2020, this meant that many businesses that had begun to reopen in May/June were forced to again scale back or close indoor operations in July, dramatically affecting revenue and operations during that quarter.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – “Color‑Tier Reopening System”
  Order Number: (State Public Health Officer Order, August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (effective August 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021  
  Rescinded By: The June 15, 2021 “Beyond Blueprint” Order
  
  Summary:
  On August 28, 2020, California unveiled a new long‑term, risk‑based “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” that replaced the earlier blanket mandates with a color‑coded tier system. Based on local data, counties were assigned a tier (Purple, Red, Orange, or Yellow) that dictated what type of indoor and outdoor operations were allowed. In Ventura County, including Camarillo, conditions in August and September placed the area in the most restrictive tiers, meaning that many indoor operations (such as dine‑in restaurants, gyms, and entertainment venues) remained heavily limited. Although this framework eventually allowed for gradual reopening, during most of Q3 2020 the restrictions still kept many Camarillo businesses from fully normal operations.

• Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order – “ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown”
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; took effect December 6, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021  
  Rescinded By: A statewide announcement by Public Health Officials lifting the order as ICU projections improved
  
  Summary:
  Although this was a late‑2020 order (Q4), its introduction underscored the ongoing risk and uncertainty. The Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order was triggered when ICU capacity fell below 15% in parts of Southern California—including Ventura County. It forced further shutdown of both indoor and (in some cases) outdoor operations in high‑risk sectors. While Q3 2020 was not directly under this order, the looming threat of further restrictions (and the eventual imposition in December) explains why many businesses in Camarillo were cautious and had already been operating under severe limitations during the third quarter.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – (Executive Order N‑07‑21 / State Health Officer Order)
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (effective June 15, 2021)  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order itself ended previous restrictions)
  
  Summary:
  This order marked California’s full reopening by terminating the earlier stay‑at‑home and tier‑based orders. It lifted most capacity limits and distancing requirements on businesses. In retrospect, it highlights that during Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo were operating under conditions that would not be fully eased until more than half a year later. The prolonged period of restrictions in 2020 is a key reason why Q3 2020 was especially difficult for local businesses.

───────────────────────────────────────────────  
Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – “County Declaration of Local Health Emergency”
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–21 (the emergency remained in effect until later, in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A later Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution ending the emergency
  
  Summary:
  On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency. Although this declaration did not itself impose business restrictions, it provided the legal authority for the county to issue further health orders that directly affected business operations. In Q3 2020, the continued local emergency status allowed Ventura County to enforce and modify measures that impacted Camarillo businesses.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – “Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions”
  Order Date: March 17, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on March 20, 2020 by the “Stay Well at Home” order  
  Rescinded By: A subsequent order on March 20, 2020
  
  Summary:
  Before the statewide order was fully in place, Ventura County issued its own order on March 17, 2020 which closed certain venues (such as bars, gyms, nightclubs, and theaters) and directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place. Although quickly incorporated into broader orders, this early step set the stage for strict local measures. Its proactive approach is part of the legacy of aggressive county‐level responses that continued to affect business operations even into Q3 2020.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – “Countywide Stay‑at‑Home Order”
  Order Date: March 20, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (in line with the state’s full reopening)  
  Rescinded By: The Ventura County Health Officer’s update on June 15, 2021
  
  Summary:
  Issued as the local companion to the statewide mandate, this order required all Ventura County residents to remain at home except for essential needs. It forced almost all non‑essential businesses to close or drastically limit operations. Even after gradual reopening began, many operational limits (such as reduced capacity) were inherited from this original order. In Q3 2020, many Camarillo businesses were still indirectly subject to restrictions that originated from the “Stay Well at Home” order.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – “Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols”
  Order Dates:  
    – March 31, 2020: Extended the stay‑home order to April 19, 2020  
    – April 9, 2020: Added a ban on gatherings and required safety protocols for essential businesses  
    – April 20, 2020: Further extended the stay‑home order to May 15, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by later reopening orders (May 2020 onward)
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s May 7, 2020 “Safely Reopening” order
  
  Summary:
  Throughout March and April 2020, Ventura County repeatedly updated its orders. These updates tightened restrictions, such as forbidding any gatherings outside of a single household and mandating social distancing and safety plans for businesses that were allowed to remain open. While the specific language of these early orders was later replaced, the safety protocols they established (masking, distancing, reduced capacity) continued to influence the way businesses—such as those in Camarillo—operated into Q3 2020.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – “Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)”
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 (initial order) and May 20, 2020 (amendment)  
  Date Rescinded: Later superseded by the state’s Blueprint order on August 31, 2020 and ultimately by the June 15, 2021 reopening
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer’s updates aligning with state reopening
  
  Summary:
  As the early lockdown began to ease, Ventura County issued the “Safely Reopening” order which allowed many essential and lower‑risk businesses to resume operations under strict health protocols. With the May 20, 2020 amendment, higher‑risk sectors like dine‑in restaurants were allowed to reopen with modifications. This set the reopening framework for the county and provided a temporary lifeline for many Camarillo businesses. However, with a summer surge in cases, some of these reopenings were later rolled back in July 2020, meaning that although businesses had started to adapt, they quickly had to face renewed restrictions during Q3.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – “Temporary Beach Closure (Holiday Weekend)”
  Order Date: Issued on June 30, 2020 for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend  
  Date Rescinded: Automatically expired after July 5, 2020
  Rescinded By: Its own terms (it was a temporary, limited‑time measure)
  
  Summary:
  In anticipation of heavy crowds on the Independence Day weekend and the risk of super‑spreader events, Ventura County ordered that beaches and beach parking lots be closed for that holiday weekend (details at “https://abc7.com/ventura-county-beaches-july-4-2020-4th-of-weekend-open-for/6286107/#:~:text=Ventura%20County%20beaches%20to%20close,coronavirus%20cases%2C%20Ventura%20County”). While Camarillo is inland, this targeted order reduced regional tourism and impacted nearby coastal businesses, indirectly affecting Camarillo’s local economy during Q3 2020.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – “Local Implementation of State Rollback”
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: October 6, 2020 (as the county moved into a less‑restrictive tier)  
  Rescinded By: A subsequent Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020
  
  Summary:
  In line with the state’s July 13 rollback, Ventura County issued a local order to re‑implement stricter closures on indoor operations for sectors such as gyms, personal care services, and places of worship. This order forced many Camarillo businesses that had begun to reopen in May and June to again shut down or operate only with outdoor or limited capacity. This re‑closure during July clearly affected business revenues and operations in Q3 2020.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – “Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020”
  Order Date: October 6, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (in part, due to subsequent regional orders)
  Rescinded By: Later orders (including the December 2020 Regional Stay‑at‑Home Order and eventual statewide changes)
  
  Summary:
  As COVID‑19 case numbers improved in early fall 2020, Ventura County moved into the Red tier of the State’s Blueprint system with an order on October 6, 2020. This allowed selected indoor operations (such as gyms, houses of worship, and personal care services) to reopen under strict capacity and safety protocols. For businesses in Camarillo, this provided tentative relief at the tail end of Q3 2020; however, many businesses had already suffered prolonged closures during the earlier summer months.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – “Temporary Ban on Evictions (Rent Deferral)”
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (and subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: Initially April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; originally passed March 31, 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, through September 30, 2020 (for residential, later replaced by state law via AB 3088 beginning September 2020)
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 preempted local bans for residential tenants; for commercial, the county allowed the extension to expire
  
  Summary:
  To help both residents and small businesses cope with the financial shocks from COVID‑19, Ventura County approved an eviction moratorium (Urgency Ordinance No. 4563). This measure temporarily halted evictions for tenants—both residential and commercial—facing nonpayment due to pandemic‑related hardships. For Camarillo businesses, this meant protection from being immediately forced out of their leased premises during Q3 2020, even though it did not cancel rent obligations but merely deferred them.

───────────────────────────────────────────────  
City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – “City Declaration of Emergency”
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20‑1 (Emergency Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution No. 20‑36 on the same day)  
  Date Rescinded: The local emergency remained in effect throughout 2020–2021 (formally ended in 2022)
  Rescinded By: A City Council resolution (in 2022, after the period in question)
  
  Summary:
  On March 13, 2020, the City of Camarillo declared a local emergency due to COVID‑19. This declaration activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center and enabled swift local measures such as closure of city facilities and cancellation of public events. For businesses, the prolonged emergency meant that the city could continue to enforce COVID‑19 restrictions and offer regulatory relief (for instance, streamlined outdoor dining permits). In Q3 2020, the presence of the emergency declaration reinforced public health priorities and influenced customer behavior—further challenging local business operations.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – “Citywide Moratorium on Evictions”
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20‑2 (March 18, 2020) and its Amendment (April 23, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: Initially on March 18, 2020, then amended on April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: For residential tenants, superseded by state law (AB 3088 on August 31, 2020); any remaining commercial provisions ended when the local emergency was terminated (later in 2022)
  Rescinded By: State law for residential; the City’s emergency later ended local provisions
  
  Summary:
  To protect tenants during the pandemic, Camarillo issued its own eviction moratorium beginning on March 18, 2020 which was amended on April 23, 2020. This order prevented landlords within the city from evicting tenants—residential or commercial—who were unable to pay rent due to pandemic‑related financial hardships. For local businesses in Q3 2020 that were struggling with reduced revenue, this moratorium offered vital protection from immediate eviction, helping them stay in place while they navigated limited operations under COVID restrictions.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020‑63 – “Temporary Outdoor Dining Program”
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Effectively ended when COVID‑19 capacity restrictions were lifted (around June 15, 2021, as full indoor dining resumed)
  Rescinded By: The automatic sunset tied to the end of the local state of emergency and reinstatement of standard zoning rules
  
  Summary:
  Faced with the prohibition or severe limitation on indoor dining, the City of Camarillo adopted Resolution No. 2020‑63 to allow restaurants to create temporary outdoor dining areas. This measure waived certain zoning requirements and fees so that restaurants could quickly set up outdoor seating (such as in parking lots or on sidewalks). During Q3 2020, when indoor dining was still not widely allowed due to health orders, this resolution was a lifeline for local eateries. It enabled them to continue serving customers safely outdoors—helping to partially mitigate losses during a very challenging period.
  
• Miscellaneous City Measures – “Additional Camarillo Actions”
  Dates: Various throughout spring and summer 2020
  
  Summary:
  In addition to the formal orders outlined above, the City of Camarillo implemented several supportive measures. These included suspending late fees for business taxes, shifting permit and application processes online to reduce in‑person contact, and promoting take‑out dining to support local restaurants. Although not all of these are “orders” in the strictest sense, taken together they formed part of the city’s comprehensive COVID‑19 response that affected Camarillo’s business environment in Q3 2020.

───────────────────────────────────────────────  
Overall Analysis

Across all levels of government—from federal declarations to state mandates, county health orders, and local city resolutions—the regulatory landscape during 2020–2021 created a patchwork of restrictions and relief measures that directly affected businesses in Camarillo, California. For Q3 2020, many businesses experienced a rollercoaster effect:

– The initial, strict lockdown measures (such as the statewide stay‑at‑home order) forced many businesses to close or operate at drastically reduced capacity.
  
– The gradual, and then sometimes abruptly reversed, reopening orders (for example, the May “Safely Reopening” orders followed by the July rollbacks) meant businesses had little stability.
  
– Local measures—including eviction moratoriums and the introduction of outdoor dining—provided some relief but also added new operational challenges and costs.
  
– The continued state of emergency and ongoing public concern further influenced consumer behavior (with fewer people venturing out), thereby affecting revenue.
  
The cumulative effect of these multiple orders is why Q3 2020 was a uniquely difficult quarter for Camarillo businesses. Even as state and local policymakers tried to balance public health with economic needs, the necessity of rapidly shifting orders meant that many sectors saw frequent changes in their operating conditions.
