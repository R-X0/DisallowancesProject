──────────────────────────────
Federal Orders

• Proclamation 9994 – National Emergency Concerning COVID-19  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 【43†L106-L115】  
  Date Rescinded: N/A during 2020–2021 (remained in effect; continued by the President on Feb. 24, 2021 【43†L106-L115】)  
  Rescinded By: Terminated later by Congress in 2023 (outside our 2020–2021 scope)  
  Summary: This proclamation declared a nationwide emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak. It activated federal emergency powers and funding, thereby indirectly enabling subsequent state and local lockdowns and restrictions. Although it did not itself mandate business closures, it provided the legal and policy basis for further measures. In Q3 2020, businesses in Camarillo operated under a national emergency context—federal stimulus support was available even while stricter state and local health orders continued to restrict operations. The ongoing national emergency underscored the severity of the pandemic and justified the continued measures at the local level.

• CDC/FAA Mask Mandates – Federal Mask Requirements for Travel  
  Date Enacted: January 21, 2021 (Executive Order 13998 on travel safety); CDC Order effective Feb. 1, 2021  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2021 (in effect throughout 2021; later lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A court order on April 18, 2022 ended the CDC travel mask mandate  
  Summary: While not directly targeting private businesses, these federal mandates required masks on airplanes, trains, buses, airports, and federal properties. They represented the federal government’s evolving strategy to ensure travel safety amid rising cases. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, which predated these measures (beginning 2021), the federal focus remained on emergency declarations rather than direct mandates impacting non–travel-related business operations.

Note on Federal Orders: The primary restrictions affecting Camarillo businesses in 2020 stemmed from state and local orders. The federal actions chiefly provided emergency declarations, guidance, and funding, rather than dictating direct business operations.

California State Orders

• State of Emergency Proclamation – California COVID-19 State of Emergency  
  Order Number: N/A (Governor’s Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 4, 2020 【45†L72-L80】  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained in effect throughout)  
  Rescinded By: Ended February 28, 2023 by a later governor’s proclamation  
  Summary: Governor Gavin Newsom’s proclamation on March 4, 2020 established a state of emergency in California due to COVID-19. This declaration allowed the state to mobilize resources, suspend certain regulations, and later issue lockdown orders with the full force of emergency authority. In Q3 2020, since the state of emergency was still in effect, businesses continued to be subject to extraordinary public health directives and economic relief measures that had been authorized under this emergency status.

• Executive Order N-33-20 – Statewide “Stay-at-Home” Order  
  Date Enacted: March 19, 2020 【47†L31-L39】 (effective immediately)  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 【58†L1-L4】  
  Rescinded By: Executive Order N-07-21 (June 11, 2021) terminated the statewide Stay-at-Home order  
  Summary: This executive order mandated that all California residents remain at home except for essential needs, forcing “non-essential” businesses (such as dine-in restaurants, retail stores, gyms, salons, and theaters) to close or adapt operations. By Q3 2020, while some phased reopening had begun, many restrictions originally set in March still influenced business operating conditions – for instance, limiting restaurant capacity to outdoor or take-out service. The order’s persistence reflected ongoing public health concerns and explains why many Camarillo businesses continued to operate under reduced capacity or temporary closures during Q3 2020.

• State Public Health Officer Order (Stage 2 Reopening) – Modifying Stay-at-Home (Early Stage 2)  
  Order Date/Number: May 7, 2020 (issued under Executive Order N-60-20) 【18†L39-L47】  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 【22†L407-L414】 (superseded by the “Beyond Blueprint” order)  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Beyond Blueprint” Order on June 11, 2021  
  Summary: As case numbers plateaued in spring 2020, California initiated Stage 2 reopening to relax the earlier stay-home restrictions. This order allowed lower-risk businesses—such as certain retail stores (offering curbside pickup) and manufacturing operations—to reopen under strict safety protocols, while higher-risk venues (like dine-in restaurants, gyms, and salons) remained closed. For a business in Camarillo in Q3 2020, this order meant that some establishments could resume operations (albeit under limited conditions), though the threat of a summer surge led to subsequent rollbacks. The order reflected a balancing act between reviving economic activity and controlling the virus spread.

• State Public Health Officer Order (July 13, 2020) – Statewide Rollback of Reopening  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 【18†L49-L57】  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded on August 31, 2020 by the “Blueprint” tier framework; later formally rescinded on June 15, 2021 【22†L407-L414】  
  Rescinded By: The State Public Health Officer “Blueprint” Order (August 28, 2020) and later by the Beyond Blueprint Order  
  Summary: In response to a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in July 2020, the state re-imposed restrictions on previously reopened sectors. The order mandated the closure of many indoor operations once again – including indoor dining for restaurants, bars, and many leisure venues – while still allowing some outdoor or take-out services. For Camarillo businesses, this abrupt rollback significantly reduced operating capacity compared to the brief reopenings of May/June 2020. The summer surge forced many establishments, such as gyms and salons, to again close their indoor premises, heavily impacting revenues and operations throughout Q3 2020.

• “Blueprint for a Safer Economy” Framework – Color-Tier Reopening System  
  Order Number: State Public Health Officer Order (August 28, 2020)  
  Date Enacted: August 28, 2020 (announced; effective August 31, 2020) 【51†L68-L76】  
  Date Rescinded: June 15, 2021 【22†L407-L414】  
  Rescinded By: The “Beyond Blueprint” Order effective June 15, 2021  
  Summary: This framework replaced the earlier “stay-at-home” orders with a graduated, color-coded tier system (Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow) based on local COVID-19 metrics. Each tier set detailed requirements for which business operations could resume and at what capacity. Ventura County—and by extension Camarillo—entered the most restrictive Purple tier on August 31, 2020, meaning that even though the blanket July closures had ended, most businesses still operated under heavy constraints (for example, only curbside or very limited indoor service was permitted). The system was designed to ease or tighten restrictions gradually based on data; however, during Q3 2020 many Camarillo businesses continued to face severe limitations under the Purple tier.

• Regional Stay-at-Home Order – ICU Capacity Triggered Shutdown  
  Order Date: December 3, 2020 (announced; effective December 6, 2020) 【59†L55-L63】【59†L75-L83】  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 【54†L355-L363】  
  Rescinded By: A state Public Health Officials’ announcement lifting the order on January 25, 2021  
  Summary: In late 2020, in response to critically low ICU capacity in the Southern California region (where Ventura County is included), the state issued a Regional Stay-at-Home Order. This order enforced an even stricter lockdown, closing many indoor—and in some cases even outdoor—business operations, including restaurants (in-person dining even outdoors), personal care services (such as salons), movie theaters, museums, and retail facilities (with capacity cut to as low as 20%). Although this order took effect in December 2020 (falling into Q4 2020), its existence underscored the unpredictability facing businesses. Even in Q3 2020, the looming threat of such drastic measures meant that business operators were operating under considerable uncertainty.

• “Beyond the Blueprint” Reopening Order – Termination of Previous Business Restrictions  
  Order Number: Executive Order N-07-21 / State Public Health Officer Order (June 11, 2021)  
  Date Enacted: June 11, 2021 (EO signed; effective June 15, 2021) 【20†L63-L70】【22†L407-L414】  
  Date Rescinded: N/A (this order itself ended the previous restrictions)  
  Rescinded By: This order rescinded remaining COVID business restrictions such as capacity limits and the tier framework  
  Summary: This pair of orders marked the full reopening of California on June 15, 2021, officially terminating the longstanding stay-at-home and tiered restrictions. While this order clearly falls after Q3 2020, it serves to highlight that businesses in Q3 2020 continued to operate under tight rules until improvements in public health metrics allowed for a complete reopening. In essence, the prolonged restrictions through Q3 2020 – which meant reduced operations for many Camarillo businesses – eventually set the stage for a full resumption of normal business conditions in mid-2021.

──────────────────────────────
Ventura County Orders

• Ventura County Local Health Emergency – County Declaration of Local Health Emergency  
  Order/Proclamation Date: March 12, 2020 【38†L19-L27】  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained effective; ultimately ended in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Board of Supervisors resolution (March 2022, beyond our scope)  
  Summary: On March 12, 2020, Ventura County’s Public Health Officer declared a local health emergency in response to COVID-19. Although this declaration did not itself impose business restrictions, it provided the authority for subsequent local orders and helped align with state and federal directives. For businesses in Q3 2020, the ongoing local health emergency ensured that any additional local restrictions or guidelines could be immediately enforced to protect public health.

• Ventura County Public Health Order (March 17, 2020) – Initial County Closures/Gathering Restrictions  
  Order Date: March 17, 2020 【61†L78-L83】  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Stay Well at Home” order on March 20, 2020 【61†L95-L102】  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer order of March 20, 2020  
  Summary: Before the state’s statewide mandate, Ventura County issued an order on March 17, 2020 that directed vulnerable residents to shelter in place and ordered the closure of certain public venues and businesses such as bars, gyms, and theaters. Although this specific order was soon folded into a broader stay-home directive, it set a precedent for the county’s willingness to act swiftly. Its early action helped establish the pattern of aggressive local intervention that continued into Q3 2020 via later, modified orders.

• “Stay Well at Home” Order (Ventura County) – Countywide Stay-Home Order  
  Order Date: March 20, 2020 【61†L95-L102】  
  Date Rescinded: June 11, 2021 (aligned with state reopening; formally ended on June 15, 2021 as the county lifted restrictions) 【7†L29-L35】  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order (June 15, 2021)  
  Summary: Complementing California’s statewide stay-at-home order, Ventura County’s “Stay Well at Home” order required all residents to stay indoors except for essential reasons and forced non-essential businesses to halt in-person operations. This order led to nearly all Camarillo businesses ceasing face-to-face activity unless classified as essential. Even though by Q3 2020 many modifications had been introduced (allowing partial or phased reopening), the framework and mentality of “stay at home” continued to underlie business operations, limiting capacity and affecting service delivery.

• Ventura County Public Health Order Updates (March–April 2020) – Extensions and Social Distancing Protocols  
  Order Dates:  
  – March 31, 2020: Extension of the stay-home order until April 19, 2020 【6†L73-L77】  
  – April 9, 2020: Added prohibition on gatherings and required social distancing protocols 【13†L49-L57】【13†L39-L47】  
  – April 20, 2020: Further extended the order through May 15, 2020 【61†L95-L102】  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the “Safely Reopening” order on May 7, 2020; the April orders were formally replaced by state-aligned regulations  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on May 7, 2020  
  Summary: Ventura County updated its stay-home order several times during spring 2020 as the situation evolved. These updates not only prolonged the restrictions but also tightened the rules—such as banning all gatherings and mandating social distancing for essential business operations. Although by Q3 2020 these specific updates had been replaced by reopening protocols, their legacy was directly evident: the safety measures (masking, distancing, capacity limits) that many Camarillo businesses continued to follow were rooted in these early county orders.

• “Safely Reopening Ventura County” Order – Stage 2 County Reopening (May 2020)  
  Order Dates: May 7, 2020 and an amendment on May 20, 2020 【6†L64-L72】【29†L437-L445】  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by the state’s Blueprint order (effective August 31, 2020) and fully ended with the June 15, 2021 reopening  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on August 31, 2020 (which aligned the county with the state’s new tier system)  
  Summary: In response to signs of improvement in early May 2020, Ventura County issued its “Safely Reopening” order, which repealed the stricter earlier orders and permitted many lower-risk businesses to reopen under conditions. On May 20, an amendment allowed dine-in restaurants and in-store retail to resume with significant operational modifications (such as limited capacity and enhanced sanitation protocols). For Q3 2020, this order meant that many Camarillo businesses were able to reopen; however, the measures were still fragile as later surges (e.g., the July rollback) forced further restrictions. The order illustrates the cautious, phased approach local government used—again influencing business operations well into Q3 2020.

• Ventura County 4th of July Closure Order – Temporary Beach Closure  
  Order Date: June 30, 2020 (for the July 3–5, 2020 weekend) 【39†L5-L12】  
  Date Rescinded: The order expired on July 6, 2020  
  Rescinded By: It expired as originally specified for the Independence Day weekend  
  Summary: To prevent large gatherings on beaches during the popular holiday weekend, Ventura County ordered nearby beaches to close and parking lots to be inaccessible. Although Camarillo is inland, the order affected regional tourism and indirectly impacted local businesses that rely on visitor spending. The temporary closure was a targeted public health measure meant to prevent super-spreader events, and it illustrates the kind of sudden, short-term restrictions that businesses in Q3 2020 had to contend with.

• Ventura County July 2020 Order – Local Implementation of State Rollback  
  Order Date: July 13, 2020 (effective July 14, 2020) 【9†L31-L39】  
  Date Rescinded: Partially rescinded on October 6, 2020 as the county moved into Tier 2 【9†L31-L39】  
  Rescinded By: Ventura County Health Officer Order on October 6, 2020, which lifted some of the indoor closure requirements  
  Summary: Following the statewide July 13 rollback, Ventura County issued a local order that mandated the closure of indoor operations for many sectors—including gyms, places of worship, personal care services, and bars—in line with the state rollback. This directly affected many businesses in Camarillo that had reopened in May/June but then had to close indoor services again in July. For many sectors, especially those that could not easily convert to outdoor-only operations, the order meant continuing loss of revenue throughout the rest of Q3 2020 until conditions improved.

• Ventura County “Red Tier” Reopening Order – Easing Restrictions in Fall 2020  
  Order Date: October 6, 2020 【9†L13-L21】【9†L31-L39】  
  Date Rescinded: January 25, 2021 (later overridden by more regional orders)  
  Rescinded By: The December Regional Stay-at-Home Order prevented a full reopening until further notice  
  Summary: With improved COVID metrics, Ventura County moved into the Red tier in early October 2020. The Health Officer’s order allowed indoor operations for certain businesses (such as gyms, churches, and personal care providers) under strict protocols. Though issued at the very end of Q3 2020, this easing signaled hope for eventual normalization. However, many businesses had already endured months of intermittent closures and reduced capacities, highlighting the prolonged hardship experienced during Q3.

• Ventura County Eviction Moratorium – Temporary Ban on Evictions  
  Order/Ordinance Number: Urgency Ordinance No. 4563 (with subsequent extensions)  
  Date Enacted: April 22, 2020 (retroactive to March 2020; initial ordinance passed March 31, 2020) 【6†L66-L72】  
  Date Rescinded: For commercial evictions, extended through September 30, 2020; for residential, later replaced by state law (AB 3088)  
  Rescinded By: For residential, superseded by California’s COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act (AB 3088, Aug. 31, 2020); commercial protections ended in Ventura County as scheduled  
  Summary: To help both residents and small business tenants avoid immediate displacement amid losing revenue, Ventura County passed an eviction moratorium that temporarily halted evictions for nonpayment of rent due to pandemic-related hardship. For small businesses in Camarillo renting space, this meant they could defer rent payments and avoid possible closure due to eviction while they struggled through low-revenue months in Q3 2020. Although the moratorium did not cancel rent obligations, it provided critical temporary relief during a time when many businesses were barely operating.

──────────────────────────────
City of Camarillo Orders

• Local Emergency Proclamation (Camarillo) – City Declaration of Emergency  
  Order Number: EOC Director Order No. 20-1 (Emergency Proclamation)  
  Date Enacted: March 13, 2020 (ratified by City Council Resolution 20-36 on March 13, 2020) 【38†L29-L37】  
  Date Rescinded: Not rescinded during 2020–2021 (remained effective until lifted in 2022)  
  Rescinded By: A later Camarillo City Council resolution ending the local COVID emergency (April 2022)  
  Summary: On March 13, 2020, Camarillo declared a local emergency. This declaration activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and allowed immediate deployment of municipal resources and the issuance of emergency measures such as facility closures and event cancellations. In Q3 2020, the city’s emergency status meant that city policies and permits (for example, for outdoor dining) could be streamlined while simultaneously enforcing safety protocols. The sustained local emergency declaration reinforced the seriousness of the pandemic and affected business operations by ensuring ongoing local coordination with county and state measures.

• Camarillo Eviction Moratorium Orders – Citywide Moratorium on Evictions  
  Order Numbers: EOC Director Order No. 20-2 (March 18, 2020) and an amendment on April 23, 2020 【35†L218-L222】  
  Date Enacted: March 18, 2020 (initial), amended April 23, 2020  
  Date Rescinded: Superseded by state law on residential evictions (Sept. 2020) and eventually ended with the local emergency’s conclusion  
  Rescinded By: California AB 3088 (for residential tenants) and later city actions for any remaining provisions  
  Summary: Camarillo’s local government issued an eviction moratorium to protect both residential tenants and small businesses facing financial hardship during COVID-19. This order provided legal protection against immediate eviction for those unable to pay rent due to pandemic-related income loss. For Camarillo businesses in Q3 2020, such measures were vital, as they allowed business owners to negotiate rent deferrals without risking sudden closure, thereby providing a modicum of financial stability even while operating under restrictive health orders.

• Camarillo Resolution No. 2020-63 – Temporary Outdoor Dining Program  
  Date Enacted: June 10, 2020 (approximately; passed in early June 2020)  
  Date Rescinded: Expired with the end of most COVID capacity restrictions (effectively June 15, 2021, when full indoor dining resumed)  
  Rescinded By: Automatically sunset as the local emergency ended and zoning rules returned to normal  
  Summary: Recognizing that indoor dining had been severely curtailed, the Camarillo City Council adopted a resolution to waive some zoning requirements and fees so that restaurants could set up temporary outdoor dining spaces. This measure allowed restaurants to serve customers safely outdoors, thereby partially offsetting losses incurred from prolonged indoor closures. In Q3 2020, when many restaurants faced intermittent indoor shutdowns due to state and county restrictions, this outdoor dining program was a critical lifeline. It helped businesses continue operations and generate revenue while adhering to public health guidelines.

• Miscellaneous City Measures – Additional Camarillo Actions  
  Dates: Various throughout 2020 (spring to summer)  
  Summary: In addition to the major orders above, the City of Camarillo implemented several measures to ease the burden on local businesses. These actions included suspending late fees for business taxes, moving permit processes online to reduce in-person contact, and launching take-out dining campaigns. While not formal “orders” in the traditional sense, these policies further shaped the operating environment for Camarillo businesses during the challenging Q3 2020 period.

Overall Discussion

During the third quarter of 2020 (Q3 2020), businesses in Camarillo were navigating a remarkably challenging environment. Federal actions set the emergency context, but it was largely the state, county, and city orders that directly imposed operational limitations. Q3 2020 saw many businesses forced to alternate between brief reopenings (supported by initial “Stage 2” orders) and sudden rollbacks (as seen in the July 13 statewide order and local implementations). The combination of stringent public health mandates, capacity limits, and even localized temporary closures (such as the 4th of July beach closure) meant that many Camarillo businesses struggled to operate at any normal level. Moreover, supportive measures like eviction moratoria and outdoor dining programs were critical in preventing a complete economic collapse. Ultimately, the patchwork of orders at every level (federal, state, county, and city) defined the Q3 2020 business experience by forcing a continual balancing act between mitigating public health risks and trying to sustain economic activity.
